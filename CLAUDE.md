- Individual collection search and cross-collection search modes

**Usage Workflow**
1. **Start Qdrant**: `docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant` 
2. **Load Vector Database**: `python3.9 qdrant_loader.py` (one-time setup)
3. **Test Search**: `python3.9 test_qdrant_cli.py` (interactive testing)

**Collections Available**
- `baked-breads` (885 recipes) - Baking-focused dishes
- `quick-light` (2,476 recipes) - Fast preparation and light meals  
- `protein-mains` (1,379 recipes) - Meat, poultry, seafood main dishes
- `comfort-cooked` (718 recipes) - Slow-cooked and braised dishes
- `desserts-sweets` (2,465 recipes) - All sweet treats and desserts
- `breakfast-morning` (415 recipes) - Morning-specific foods
- `plant-based` (78 recipes) - Vegetarian and vegan dishes
- `fresh-cold` (950 recipes) - Salads and raw preparations

### Environment Setup

**Required Environment Variables**
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here  # For summary generation
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333        # Vector database connection
```

**Python Version**: Use `python3.9` for all recipe service scripts

### Common Issues and Solutions

**API Overload (503 Errors)**
- **Cause**: High-volume Gemini API usage
- **Solution**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s)
- **Recovery**: Automatically resumes from last successful batch

**String Concatenation Errors**  
- **Cause**: Mixed data types in recipe data (floats, nulls)
- **Solution**: Automatic type conversion and null handling in batch processing

**Empty Summaries**
- **Detection**: Automatic empty file detection and regeneration
- **Validation**: Test suite checks for content quality and completeness

**Collection Management**
- **Beverages**: Intentionally excluded from processing as requested
- **Switching**: Easy to include/exclude collections by modifying configuration

### Performance Metrics

**Classification Performance**
- **Speed**: ~1,000 recipes/minute on standard hardware
- **Accuracy**: Function-based approach provides better semantic grouping than cuisine-based
- **Confidence**: Average confidence scores tracked per collection

**Summary Generation Performance**  
- **Throughput**: ~50-100 summaries/minute (depends on API limits)
- **Quality**: 95%+ success rate after error handling improvements
- **Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces API calls by 10-50x vs individual requests

### Development Workflow and Decisions

**Why Function-Based Classification?**
- **Better Semantic Grouping**: Users search by cooking method/meal type, not cuisine
- **Improved Search Quality**: "baked desserts" vs "Italian desserts" - more useful categories  
- **RAG Optimization**: Collections align with user intent and meal planning needs
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new functional categories as dataset grows

**Why Summary-Based Embeddings?**
- **Quality**: Gemini-generated summaries are more coherent than raw recipe text
- **Consistency**: Standardized format eliminates noise from varied recipe sources
- **Performance**: Shorter text = faster embedding generation and search
- **Semantic Density**: Summaries capture key recipe elements without irrelevant details

**Why Exclude Beverages?**
- **User Requirement**: Explicitly excluded from meal planning scope
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus processing power on relevant food categories
- **Clean Separation**: Beverages require different search patterns than food recipes

**Technical Architecture Decisions**
- **Batch Processing**: Reduces API costs and improves reliability vs individual calls  
- **File-Based Caching**: Simple, reliable persistence with easy debugging
- **Collection Separation**: Enables targeted search within specific meal categories
- **Summary Validation**: Automated testing ensures quality before vector database loading

**Error Handling Philosophy**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing despite individual failures
- **Smart Retry**: Exponential backoff for API limits, immediate retry for network issues
- **Resume Capability**: Always allow restarting from last successful point
- **Data Preservation**: Never overwrite good data, only regenerate empty/failed items

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality and Linting
- **Always run linting** before committing code
- **Python services**: Use `ruff check .` and `ruff format .` for code formatting (if configured)
- **Frontend/API Gateway**: Check individual `package.json` files for ESLint/Prettier configurations
- **Testing**: Run tests before merging - use service-specific test commands above

### Adding New Features
1. Determine appropriate service or create new microservice
2. Follow FastAPI patterns for backend services
3. Use existing database models and schemas as templates
4. Implement health checks for new services
5. Update docker-compose.yml for new services

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in `/tests/unit/` directories
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/` directories
- End-to-end testing via Python scripts
- RAG workflow testing scripts for AI functionality

### Database Migrations
- Use SQLAlchemy for Python services
- Migration files should be added to `/migrations/` if created
- Services auto-create tables on startup (see `init.sql` files)

### Environment Configuration
- Environment variables defined in docker-compose.yml
- Database credentials and API keys configured per service
- JWT secrets must be consistent across gateway and user service

### AI/ML Components
- Recipe embeddings generated using SentenceTransformers (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Recipe summaries generated using Google Gemini API for better semantic search
- Vector similarity search for recipe recommendations via Qdrant
- LLM prompts stored in `/prompts/` directories
- Embedding dimension: 768 (matches all-mpnet-base-v2)

### File Structure Patterns
- Each microservice follows similar structure: `/app/controllers/`, `/app/services/`, `/app/models/`, `/app/repositories/`
- React components in `/src/components/`, pages in `/src/pages/`
- Shared utilities in `/src/services/` for frontend

**1. Robust Error Handling & Retry Logic**
- 3-tier retry system with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
- Graceful degradation with multiple fallback strategies
- Smart ingredient preprocessing with type validation
- JSON response cleaning (removes markdown formatting)
- Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

**2. Enhanced Ingredient Processing**
- Advanced ingredient aggregation and deduplication
- Unit standardization and quantity consolidation  
- Category-based ingredient classification
- Handles mixed data types (strings, arrays, nulls)
- Intelligent cleanup of malformed ingredient data

**3. Improved User Experience**
- Enhanced loading states with progress indicators
- Detailed error messages with retry buttons
- Organized display by grocery store categories
- Quantity chips and hover effects
- Refresh functionality and empty state handling
- Professional UI with category sections and item counts

**4. Persistent Caching with Smart Invalidation (NEW in v2.1.0)**
- Grocery lists are automatically saved to database after generation
- Cached lists are served instantly on subsequent requests (<100ms)
- Cache is automatically cleared when meal plan changes:
  - Recipe replacement clears cache
  - Meal moving/swapping clears cache  
  - Day reordering clears cache
- Manual refresh option forces cache regeneration
- Graceful fallback handling for corrupted cache data

#### Technical Implementation

**Backend Enhancements:**
- Redesigned `generate_grocery_list()` with 3-attempt retry logic (`services/meal-planner-service/app/services/gemini_service.py`)
- New fallback methods: `_create_fallback_grocery_list_from_ingredients()` and `_create_fallback_grocery_list_from_recipes()`
- Enhanced Gemini prompt engineering for better JSON responses
- Comprehensive input validation and data type handling

**Frontend Improvements:**
- Enhanced grocery list UI with category organization (`frontend/src/pages/MealPlanner.tsx`)
- Professional loading states with detailed progress messages
- Error handling with retry buttons and helpful messaging
- Improved visual hierarchy with Paper components and chips
- Empty state with generate button for better UX

**Error Recovery Strategies:**
1. **Primary**: Gemini API with optimized prompts
2. **Secondary**: Basic ingredient categorization using keyword matching  
3. **Fallback**: Recipe name-based grocery items with manual review prompts

#### Usage Examples

**Enhanced Loading State:**
```
Generating your grocery list...
This may take a moment while we analyze your recipes
```

**Error Recovery:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to generate grocery list [Retry Button]
There was an issue generating your grocery list. You can try again or manually review your meal plan recipes.
```

**Organized Display:**
```
üì¶ Produce (5 items)
  ü•ï Carrots ‚Ä¢ 2 cups
  üßÖ Onions ‚Ä¢ 1 large
  
ü•õ Dairy (3 items)  
  ü•õ Milk ‚Ä¢ 2.5 cups
  üßà Butter ‚Ä¢ 4 tbsp
```

#### Key Files Modified

#### Performance & Reliability

**Recipe Replacement:**
- Search response: ~100-500ms (semantic search)
- Category detection: <50ms (rule-based algorithm)
- Database transaction: ~100-200ms (optimistic UI updates)

**Grocery List Generation:**
- Primary path: 1-3 seconds (Gemini API processing)
- Fallback path: 200-500ms (local categorization)
- Success rate: >95% with retry logic
- User feedback: Real-time loading states and error recovery

These enhancements significantly improve user experience and system reliability, providing intelligent recipe management and dependable grocery list functionality.
