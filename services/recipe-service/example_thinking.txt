Breakfasts are quick and easy, using protein bars and overnight oats. Salads are incorporated for lunch for fresh, lighter options. The plan prioritizes recipes with higher similarity scores, balancing variety and nutritional needs. Although desserts were suggested, these have been left out due to the need for low carb meal plans."
