Steak with Mashed Potatoes
Ingredients (serves 2):
For the Steak:

2 steaks (ribeye, sirloin, or your preferred cut), about 6–8 oz (170–225 g) each

Salt and pepper, to taste

2 tbsp olive oil or butter

2 cloves garlic, smashed

2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)

1 tbsp butter (for finishing)

For the Mashed Potatoes:

4 medium russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed

4 tbsp butter

½ cup milk or heavy cream

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 garlic clove, minced (optional, for extra flavor)

2 tbsp fresh chives or parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Prepare the mashed potatoes:
In a large pot, add the peeled and cubed potatoes. Cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt.

Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat and cook the potatoes for about 15–20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender.

Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.

Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or a hand mixer until smooth.

Add the butter and milk (or cream), and continue mashing until creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

For an extra burst of flavor, sauté minced garlic in butter until fragrant and stir it into the mashed potatoes. Garnish with chopped chives or parsley.

2. Prepare and cook the steak:
While the potatoes are cooking, take the steaks out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature for about 15 minutes. This helps them cook evenly.

Season both sides of the steaks generously with salt and pepper.

Heat a skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high heat and add olive oil or butter. Once the oil is hot, add the steaks to the skillet.

Sear the steaks for about 3–4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust the cooking time based on your preferred doneness). Add the smashed garlic and fresh herbs to the pan during the last minute of cooking.

For a medium-rare steak, aim for an internal temperature of about 130°F (54°C). For medium, cook to 140°F (60°C), and for well-done, cook to 160°F (71°C).

During the last minute of cooking, add 1 tbsp butter to the pan and spoon it over the steaks for extra flavor.

Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest for 5–10 minutes before serving. This helps the juices redistribute.

3. Serve:
Plate the mashed potatoes and top them with your perfectly cooked steak.

Optionally, pour any leftover pan juices from the steak over the mashed potatoes for added flavor.

Serve with your favorite side vegetables like steamed broccoli, green beans, or a simple salad.

📝 Tips & Variations:
For a different flavor: Try adding a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese or a dollop of sour cream to your mashed potatoes.

For a rich sauce: Use the pan drippings from the steak to make a quick sauce by deglazing the pan with red wine or beef broth and adding a little butter.

Vegetarian option: You can replace the steak with grilled portobello mushrooms or veggie patties for a satisfying vegetarian version.
