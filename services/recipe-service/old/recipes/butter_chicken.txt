1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

1 tbsp lemon juice

1 tbsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

For the butter chicken sauce:

2 tbsp butter

1 large onion, finely chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tbsp ginger, minced

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp garam masala

1 tsp chili powder

1 can (400 g / 14 oz) crushed tomatoes

1 cup heavy cream or coconut cream (for a dairy-free version)

1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
Marinate the chicken:

In a large bowl, mix together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, chili powder, and salt.

Add the chicken pieces and coat them evenly. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes (up to overnight in the fridge for more flavor).

Cook the chicken:

Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.

Add the marinated chicken in batches and cook until browned and cooked through (about 5‚Äì7 minutes per batch).

Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.

Make the sauce:

In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.

Add the chopped onion and saut√© for 5 minutes until softened.

Add garlic and ginger, cooking for another 1‚Äì2 minutes until fragrant.

Add spices:

Stir in cumin, garam masala, and chili powder. Cook for another 30 seconds to release the flavors.

Simmer the sauce:

Pour in the crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for 10‚Äì15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together.

Finish the dish:

Stir in the heavy cream (or coconut cream) and sugar, if using.

Add the cooked chicken back into the pan and stir to coat with the sauce.

Simmer for another 5‚Äì7 minutes to heat the chicken through.

Serve:

Garnish with fresh cilantro.

Serve the butter chicken with basmati rice or naan bread for a complete meal.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Make it spicier: Add fresh chopped green chilies or increase the chili powder to your taste.

Vegetarian option: Substitute the chicken with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) or tofu.

For extra richness: Add a few tablespoons of cashew cream or ground almonds to the sauce.
