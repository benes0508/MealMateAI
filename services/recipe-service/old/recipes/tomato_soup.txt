Sauté aromatics:

Add tomatoes & broth:

Stir in the canned tomatoes (with juice), broth, sugar, and herbs if using.

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15–20 minutes.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Use fresh tomatoes? Roast 2 lbs of halved tomatoes with garlic and olive oil at 400°F (200°C) for 30–40 minutes, then blend and simmer with broth.

Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat.

Stir in cooked rice, pasta, or lentils for extra body.
