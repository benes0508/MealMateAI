Falafel Wrap
Ingredients (serves 4):
For the Falafel:

1 can (15 oz / 425 g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed (or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)

1 small onion, roughly chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1/4 cup fresh parsley

1/4 cup fresh cilantro

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

1/2 tsp ground turmeric (optional, for color)

1/2 tsp ground paprika

1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp black pepper

2 tbsp flour (or chickpea flour for gluten-free)

2 tbsp olive oil (for frying)

For the Wrap:

4 large whole wheat or regular tortillas or pita bread

1 cup lettuce or spinach, shredded

1 tomato, sliced

1 cucumber, sliced

1/4 red onion, thinly sliced

1/4 cup pickled turnips (optional, for extra tang)

For the Sauce (Tahini or Yogurt Sauce):

1/4 cup tahini

2 tbsp lemon juice

1 tbsp olive oil

1 garlic clove, minced

2 tbsp water (or more, to reach desired consistency)

Salt, to taste

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Make the falafel mixture:
In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne (if using), salt, and pepper. Pulse until the mixture is well combined but still slightly chunky. It should hold together when pressed.

Add the flour to the mixture and pulse again. If the mixture seems too wet, add a little more flour.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover it, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (this helps the falafel hold their shape during frying).

2. Fry the falafel:
Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.

Once the oil is hot, form the falafel mixture into small balls (about 1-2 inches in diameter) or patties, and carefully place them in the hot oil.

Fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, frying in batches if necessary.

Once cooked, transfer the falafel to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

3. Make the sauce:
In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, and water until smooth and creamy. Add more water to reach your desired consistency. Season with salt to taste.

4. Assemble the wraps:
Warm the tortillas or pita bread slightly in the pan or microwave.

Spread a spoonful of the tahini or yogurt sauce in the center of each wrap.

Layer the shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and pickled turnips (if using).

Place 3-4 falafel balls on top of the veggies, drizzle with more tahini sauce, and wrap up the tortilla tightly.

5. Serve:
Serve the falafel wraps warm with extra tahini sauce on the side for dipping, if desired.

üìù Tips & Variations:
For a spicier version: Add some chili flakes or hot sauce to the tahini sauce or inside the wrap for a little kick.

Baked falafel: For a lighter option, you can bake the falafel at 375¬∞F (190¬∞C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.

Add extras: You can add roasted vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, or bell peppers to the wrap for extra flavor.
