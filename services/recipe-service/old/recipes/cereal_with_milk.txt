Ingredients:
1 cup of your favorite cereal (cornflakes, granola, oats, etc.)

½ to 1 cup cold milk (dairy or plant-based: almond, oat, soy, etc.)

Instructions:
Pour the cereal into a bowl.

Add milk to your desired level — some like just a splash, others like it swimming.

Enjoy immediately before it gets soggy (unless you like it that way!).
