Classic Grilled Cheese Sandwich
Ingredients (makes 1 sandwich):
2 slices of bread (white, sourdough, or whole grain)

2 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, mozzarella, or your favorite melting cheese)

1–2 tbsp butter (softened, or use mayo as a twist)

Instructions:
Butter the bread:

Spread butter (or mayo) on one side of each slice of bread. This will be the outside of the sandwich.

Assemble the sandwich:

Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, in a cold pan.

Add cheese slices on top.

Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.

Grill the sandwich:

Heat a skillet over medium-low heat.

Cook the sandwich for 3–4 minutes on the first side, pressing gently with a spatula.

Flip and cook another 2–3 minutes until golden brown and the cheese is melted.

Serve hot:

Let it rest 1 minute, then slice and enjoy!
