Classic Breakfast Burrito
Ingredients (makes 2 burritos):
4 large eggs

2 medium flour tortillas (10-inch)

½ cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, etc.)

½ cup cooked breakfast sausage, bacon, or plant-based alternative (optional)

½ cup cooked hash browns or diced potatoes

¼ cup diced onion (optional)

¼ cup diced bell pepper

Salt & pepper, to taste

1–2 tbsp milk (optional, for fluffier eggs)

Salsa, sour cream, or hot sauce (for serving)

1 tbsp oil or butter (for cooking)

Instructions:
Cook veggies and meat:

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.

Sauté onion and bell pepper until soft (about 3–4 minutes).

Add pre-cooked potatoes and sausage or bacon; cook until heated through and slightly crisp. Remove from pan and set aside.

Scramble the eggs:

In a bowl, whisk eggs with milk, salt, and pepper.

Pour into the same pan and cook over medium heat, stirring gently until just set.

Assemble the burritos:

Warm the tortillas slightly (in a dry pan or microwave for 10–15 seconds).

Divide the eggs, veggie/meat mix, and cheese between the tortillas.

Add salsa or other desired toppings.

Fold and toast (optional but recommended):

Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll tightly into a burrito.

Place seam-side down in a dry skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes per side until golden and crispy.

Serve warm with more salsa or hot sauce on the side!
