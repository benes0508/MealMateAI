Grilled Chicken Wrap
Ingredients (makes 2 wraps):
2 large flour tortillas (10-inch)

1 chicken breast (grilled or pan-cooked), sliced thin

½ cup shredded lettuce

½ cup chopped tomato or sliced cherry tomatoes

¼ cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your choice)

¼ avocado, sliced (optional)

2–4 tbsp your favorite sauce (ranch, garlic mayo, tzatziki, Caesar, or hummus)

Salt & pepper, to taste

Olive oil (for cooking, if needed)

Instructions:
Cook the chicken (if not using pre-cooked):

Season with salt, pepper, and optional spices (like paprika, garlic powder, cumin).

Grill or pan-fry over medium heat with a little oil until golden and cooked through (about 6–7 minutes per side). Slice thin.

Warm the tortillas:

Heat briefly in a dry pan or microwave to make them pliable.

Assemble the wrap:

Spread your sauce on the tortilla.

Add lettuce, tomato, chicken slices, cheese, and avocado.

Roll tightly: fold in the sides, then roll from the bottom up.

Optional — toast the wrap:

Place seam-side down in a pan for 1–2 minutes per side to crisp it up.

Slice in half and enjoy!
