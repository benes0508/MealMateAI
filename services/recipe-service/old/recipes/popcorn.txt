Classic Stovetop Popcorn
Ingredients (serves 2-4):
1/2 cup popcorn kernels

2-3 tbsp vegetable oil (or coconut oil)

Salt (to taste)

Butter (optional, for topping)

Optional seasonings: garlic powder, nutritional yeast, paprika, chili powder, or parmesan cheese

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Heat the oil:
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add 2-3 popcorn kernels to the pot and cover it with a lid.

Wait for the kernels to pop. Once they pop, you‚Äôll know the oil is hot enough.

2. Pop the kernels:
Add the remaining popcorn kernels to the pot in an even layer. Cover with a lid, and shake the pot gently to ensure the kernels are spread out evenly.

Allow the popcorn to pop. Once the popping slows down (about 2-3 seconds between pops), remove the pot from the heat.

3. Season the popcorn:
If you like buttered popcorn, melt some butter and drizzle it over the popcorn.

Sprinkle with salt to taste. If you want to add other seasonings (garlic powder, chili powder, nutritional yeast, or parmesan), now is the time to get creative!

4. Serve:
Transfer the popcorn to a large bowl and serve immediately while it‚Äôs fresh and warm.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Healthier option: Use air-popped popcorn for a lower-fat version, or skip the butter and just use a little olive oil or coconut oil for popping.

Flavored popcorn: Try adding different seasonings like cinnamon sugar for a sweet option or taco seasoning for a savory kick.

Cheese popcorn: Sprinkle freshly grated parmesan cheese or a cheese powder mix for cheesy popcorn.

Sweet popcorn: For a sweet treat, drizzle with melted chocolate or caramel sauce after popping.
