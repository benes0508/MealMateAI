Classic Nachos
Ingredients (serves 4):
For the Nachos:

1 large bag of tortilla chips (about 10 oz / 280 g)

2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (or a blend of cheddar and Monterey Jack)

1 cup black beans (canned or cooked)

1/2 cup diced red onion

1/2 cup diced tomatoes

1/2 cup sliced jalape√±o peppers (fresh or pickled)

1/2 cup corn kernels (fresh, canned, or frozen)

1/4 cup sliced green onions (optional)

1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

1/2 cup sour cream (for serving)

1/4 cup salsa or pico de gallo (for serving)

1/4 cup guacamole (for serving)

Lime wedges (optional, for garnish)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C).

2. Prepare the nacho base:
On a large baking sheet, spread a layer of tortilla chips evenly. Make sure the chips are spread out in one layer, so they bake evenly.

3. Assemble the toppings:
Evenly distribute the black beans, corn, diced red onion, and diced tomatoes over the chips.

Sprinkle the shredded cheese generously over the entire dish, ensuring that the cheese covers the chips and toppings.

4. Bake the nachos:
Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10‚Äì12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges of the chips are slightly crispy.

5. Add fresh toppings:
Once the nachos are out of the oven, sprinkle the sliced jalape√±os, green onions, and chopped cilantro over the top.

If you like your nachos spicier, feel free to add extra jalape√±os or hot sauce.

6. Serve:
Serve the nachos hot with sides of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.

Optionally, garnish with lime wedges for a zesty kick.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Protein options: Add seasoned ground beef, shredded chicken, or pulled pork on top for a heartier nacho dish.
