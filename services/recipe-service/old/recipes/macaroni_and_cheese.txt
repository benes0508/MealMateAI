Classic Macaroni and Cheese
Ingredients (serves 4):
2 cups elbow macaroni (about 200 g)

2 tbsp butter

2 tbsp all-purpose flour

2 cups milk (preferably whole milk)

2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar is classic; feel free to mix with mozzarella, GruyÃ¨re, or Monterey Jack)

Â½ tsp salt

Â¼ tsp black pepper

Â½ tsp mustard powder (optional, for depth)

Optional topping: Â¼ cup breadcrumbs + 1 tbsp melted butter

Instructions:
Cook the pasta:

Boil macaroni in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.

Make the cheese sauce:

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.

Whisk in flour and cook for 1â€“2 minutes to form a roux (light golden).

Slowly whisk in the milk. Stir constantly until it thickens (about 5â€“7 minutes).

Lower heat and stir in shredded cheese until melted.

Season with salt, pepper, and mustard powder if using.

Combine:

Stir the drained pasta into the cheese sauce until well coated.

(Optional) Bake for crispy top:

Pour into a greased baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumb topping, and bake at 375Â°F (190Â°C) for 15â€“20 minutes until golden.

ðŸ”„ Variations:
Add cooked bacon, chopped tomatoes, or jalapeÃ±os for a twist.

Use gluten-free pasta and flour for a GF version.

Mix in steamed broccoli or peas for added veggies.
