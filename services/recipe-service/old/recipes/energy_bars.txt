 No-Bake Energy Bars
Ingredients (makes about 10 bars):
1 cup rolled oats

1/2 cup nut butter (peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter)

1/4 cup honey or maple syrup

1/4 cup ground flaxseeds or chia seeds (for added fiber)

1/4 cup mini chocolate chips (optional, for a little sweetness)

1/4 cup dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, or chopped dates)

1/4 cup nuts (almonds, walnuts, or cashews), chopped

1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Pinch of salt (optional)

1/4 cup water (if needed to bind the mixture)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats, nut butter, honey, ground flaxseeds, chocolate chips, dried fruit, and chopped nuts. Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt if desired.

2. Mix everything together:
Stir the ingredients together until everything is evenly coated and combined. The mixture should be thick but sticky. If it feels too dry, add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until the mixture holds together.

3. Press into a pan:
Line a small square or rectangular baking dish (about 8x8 inches) with parchment paper.

Transfer the mixture into the dish and press it down firmly with the back of a spoon or your hands, making sure it‚Äôs compact and even.

4. Chill and set:
Place the dish in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours to allow the bars to firm up.

5. Cut into bars:
Once the mixture is set, remove from the refrigerator and cut it into squares or rectangles, depending on your preferred size.

6. Serve and store:
Store the energy bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate them for longer shelf life (up to 2 weeks).

üìù Tips & Variations:
Protein boost: Add a scoop of protein powder to the mixture for an extra protein punch.

Sweetener options: You can substitute the honey or maple syrup with agave nectar or coconut syrup if you prefer a vegan option.

Flavor variations: Try adding cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa powder for different flavors.

Vegan version: Ensure the nut butter is plant-based, and use maple syrup instead of honey.
