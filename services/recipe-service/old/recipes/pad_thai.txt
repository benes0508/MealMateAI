Classic Pad Thai
Ingredients (serves 2‚Äì3):
For the Pad Thai Sauce:

3 tbsp tamarind paste (or use lime juice if you can't find it)

2 tbsp fish sauce

1 tbsp soy sauce

1 tbsp sugar (palm sugar is ideal, but regular works too)

1 tsp rice vinegar

1‚Äì2 tsp chili paste or sriracha (optional for heat)

For the Pad Thai:

200 g (7 oz) rice noodles (preferably flat, wide noodles)

2 tbsp vegetable oil

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 egg

1 cup cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu (cubed or sliced)

1 cup bean sprouts

2 green onions, chopped

1/4 cup crushed peanuts (for garnish)

1 lime, cut into wedges (for garnish)

Fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
Prepare the noodles:

Cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold water to prevent sticking. Set aside.

Make the sauce:

In a small bowl, mix together tamarind paste, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, and chili paste or sriracha (if using). Stir until sugar dissolves. Adjust seasoning to taste.

Stir-fry the ingredients:

Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or frying pan over medium-high heat.

Add minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

Push the garlic to the side and crack an egg into the pan. Scramble the egg until fully cooked, then mix it with the garlic.

Add protein and noodles:

Add your cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu to the pan and toss to combine.

Add the cooked noodles and pour the Pad Thai sauce over them. Toss everything together until well coated, making sure the noodles are evenly flavored with the sauce.

Add bean sprouts and green onions:

Toss in the bean sprouts and green onions, cooking for another 2 minutes, just until the bean sprouts begin to soften.

Serve:

Serve the Pad Thai in bowls, garnished with crushed peanuts, fresh cilantro (optional), and lime wedges on the side.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Customize the protein: Use shrimp, chicken, tofu, or even a mix of all three.

Vegetarian version: Skip the fish sauce and use soy sauce or tamari for a vegan option. Add more veggies like carrots or bell peppers.

Make it spicier: Adjust the chili paste or sriracha to your desired heat level.
