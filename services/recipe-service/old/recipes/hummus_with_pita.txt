Hummus with Pita
Ingredients (serves 4-6):
For the Hummus:

1 can (15 oz / 425 g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed (or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)

1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste)

2 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for drizzling)

2 tbsp lemon juice (freshly squeezed)

1 garlic clove, minced

1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)

2–4 tbsp water (to reach desired consistency)

A pinch of paprika (optional, for garnish)

For the Pita:

4 pita breads (whole wheat or regular, your choice)

Olive oil (for brushing)

Salt (for sprinkling)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Make the hummus:
In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and salt. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Gradually add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the hummus reaches your desired creamy consistency.

Taste and adjust seasoning if needed—add more salt, lemon juice, or garlic to suit your taste.

2. Prepare the pita:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Cut the pita bread into wedges (like pizza slices).

Place the pita wedges on a baking sheet and lightly brush both sides with olive oil.

Sprinkle a little salt over the top for added flavor.

Bake in the oven for 5–7 minutes, or until the pita is crispy and golden brown.

3. Serve:
Transfer the hummus to a serving bowl and drizzle with a little extra olive oil on top.

Optionally, sprinkle paprika over the hummus for color and a mild smoky flavor.

Serve the warm pita wedges alongside the hummus for dipping.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Add flavor: For variations, try adding roasted garlic, roasted red peppers, or olives into the hummus for extra flavor.

Make it spicier: Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or chili flakes into the hummus for a little heat.

Healthier option: For a lighter option, you can toast the pita wedges in a pan with a light spray of olive oil instead of baking.

Serve with veggies: In addition to pita, you can serve the hummus with carrot sticks, cucumber slices, or other fresh vegetables for dipping.
