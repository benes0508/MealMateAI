 Fresh Spring Rolls (Vietnamese Style)
Ingredients (makes 8 rolls):
For the Spring Rolls:

8 rice paper wrappers (available at most grocery stores or Asian markets)

1/2 cup cooked shrimp, peeled and sliced in half lengthwise (or tofu for a vegetarian option)

1/2 cup cooked vermicelli noodles (optional, for added texture)

1 cup lettuce (such as Romaine or butter lettuce), shredded

1/2 cup fresh mint leaves

1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves

1 small cucumber, julienned

1 medium carrot, julienned or grated

1/2 avocado, sliced thinly (optional)

Fresh basil leaves (optional, for extra flavor)

For the Dipping Sauce:

3 tbsp hoisin sauce

1 tbsp peanut butter (or almond butter)

1 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)

1 tsp rice vinegar

1-2 tsp water (to adjust consistency)

Crushed peanuts (optional, for garnish)

Chili flakes or sriracha (optional, for heat)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the filling ingredients:
Cook the shrimp (if not pre-cooked) by boiling or saut√©ing them until they turn pink. Slice them in half lengthwise.

If using, cook the vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process.

Wash and prepare all the fresh veggies: shred the lettuce, julienne the cucumber and carrot, slice the avocado, and gather the herbs (mint, cilantro, and basil).

2. Prepare the dipping sauce:
In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and water until smooth and well combined.

If you like extra heat, add chili flakes or a splash of sriracha. Garnish with crushed peanuts for extra crunch.

3. Assemble the spring rolls:
Fill a large shallow dish with warm water. Carefully dip one rice paper wrapper into the water for about 5-10 seconds, or until it softens and becomes pliable (don‚Äôt leave it in for too long, or it will tear).

Place the softened wrapper flat on a clean surface (like a cutting board or countertop).

Arrange a small amount of lettuce, mint, cilantro, cucumber, carrot, avocado (if using), and shrimp (or tofu) in the center of the wrapper.

If using vermicelli noodles, add a small amount of them as well.

Carefully fold the sides of the rice paper over the filling, then fold the top and bottom edges and roll it up tightly, like a burrito. Be gentle but firm as you roll, to ensure it stays closed.

4. Serve:
Arrange the spring rolls on a plate, and serve them with the peanut-hoisin dipping sauce on the side.

üìù Tips & Variations:
To make ahead: You can prepare the filling ingredients in advance, but the spring rolls are best eaten fresh. If you need to store them, cover them with a damp cloth and refrigerate for up to a few hours.

Vegetarian version: Substitute the shrimp with tofu or additional vegetables, like bell peppers, radishes, or avocado.

Add heat: If you enjoy a spicy kick, try adding sliced chili peppers into the rolls or mix sriracha into the dipping sauce.

Rice paper handling: If you find rice papers hard to work with, you can practice dipping and wrapping with a few extra sheets to get comfortable with the texture.
