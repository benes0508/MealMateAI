Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies
Ingredients (makes about 24 cookies):
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened

3/4 cup white granulated sugar

3/4 cup packed brown sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 large eggs

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Optional: 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

2. Cream the butter and sugars:
In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, using a hand mixer or stand mixer (about 2-3 minutes).

3. Add the eggs and vanilla:
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

4. Mix the dry ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing just until combined.

5. Add the chocolate chips:
Fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using).

6. Shape the cookies:
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.

7. Bake the cookies:
Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. The cookies will continue to cook slightly after being removed from the oven, so don’t overbake them.

8. Cool and serve:
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Chewy cookies: For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them (remove them when they’re still soft in the center).

Crispy cookies: If you prefer crispier cookies, bake them a little longer, until the edges are more browned.

Gluten-free: Substitute the all-purpose flour with a 1-to-1 gluten-free flour blend.

Mix-ins: You can add other mix-ins like white chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or dried fruit for variety.
