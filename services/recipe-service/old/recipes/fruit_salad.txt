Fresh Fruit Salad
Ingredients (serves 4-6):
1 cup strawberries, hulled and sliced

1 cup blueberries

1 cup grapes, halved (red or green)

1 large apple, diced (preferably a sweet variety like Fuji or Honeycrisp)

1 orange, peeled and segmented (or 1/2 cup orange segments)

1 banana, sliced

1 kiwi, peeled and sliced (optional)

1/2 cup pineapple chunks (fresh or canned)

1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional, for extra sweetness)

1 teaspoon fresh lemon or lime juice (optional, for added freshness)

Fresh mint leaves (optional, for garnish)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the fruit:
Wash and prepare all the fruit as needed: hull and slice the strawberries, halve the grapes, peel and dice the apple, peel and segment the orange, slice the banana and kiwi, and chop the pineapple into chunks.

2. Combine the fruit:
In a large mixing bowl, combine all the prepared fruit. Gently toss to mix the different types together.

3. Add sweetness and flavor:
Drizzle the honey or maple syrup over the fruit if you want a little extra sweetness.

Squeeze the lemon or lime juice over the salad to keep the fruit fresh and add a touch of tartness.

4. Serve:
Transfer the fruit salad to a serving bowl and garnish with fresh mint leaves, if desired.

Serve chilled or at room temperature, and enjoy!
