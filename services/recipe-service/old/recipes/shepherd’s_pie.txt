Shepherd’s Pie
Ingredients (serves 4-6):
For the Meat Filling:

1 lb (450 g) ground lamb (traditional), or ground beef (for a cottage pie variation)

1 medium onion, diced

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup frozen peas

1 cup carrots, diced

1/4 cup beef broth (or vegetable broth for a lighter version)

2 tbsp tomato paste

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tbsp flour (optional, for thickening)

1 tsp dried thyme

Salt and pepper, to taste

2 tbsp olive oil (or butter) for cooking

For the Mashed Potatoes:

2 lbs (900 g) potatoes, peeled and cubed (Yukon Gold or russet potatoes work well)

4 tbsp butter

1/2 cup milk or cream

Salt and pepper, to taste

1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese (optional, for extra flavor)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Prepare the mashed potatoes:
Place the peeled and cubed potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water, and add a pinch of salt.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for about 15–20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.

Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.

Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or hand mixer. Add butter and milk (or cream) and continue mashing until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

If desired, stir in the grated cheddar cheese for a cheesy mashed potato topping.

2. Make the meat filling:
In a large skillet, heat olive oil or butter over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and garlic and sauté for 2–3 minutes, until softened and fragrant.

Add the ground lamb (or beef) to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned and cooked through, about 6–8 minutes.

Stir in the diced carrots, peas, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and dried thyme. If the mixture is too thick, add beef broth to reach a saucy consistency. (Optional: sprinkle in 1 tbsp flour to help thicken the mixture.)

Let the mixture simmer for 5–10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Assemble the Shepherd’s Pie:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

Transfer the meat and vegetable mixture into a 9x9-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish, spreading it evenly.

Spoon the mashed potatoes over the top, spreading them out with a spatula to cover the filling completely.

For a nice finish, you can use a fork to create texture on the mashed potatoes by gently running it over the surface, creating small peaks. This will give a beautiful golden-brown finish when baked.

4. Bake:
Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until the top of the mashed potatoes is golden brown and slightly crispy.

If desired, you can broil the top for an additional 2–3 minutes to get an even crispier finish.

5. Serve:
Let the shepherd’s pie cool for a few minutes before serving. Slice into squares and enjoy!

📝 Tips & Variations:
Make it ahead: Shepherd’s pie can be assembled a day ahead and stored in the fridge. Just bake it when you're ready to serve.

Vegetarian version: Swap the meat for lentils or a mix of mushrooms and other vegetables like zucchini, sweet potatoes, and spinach for a hearty veggie version.

Cheesy topping: For an extra cheesy crust, sprinkle some grated cheese on top of the mashed potatoes before baking.
