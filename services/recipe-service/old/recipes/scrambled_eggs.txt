🥚 Classic Scrambled Eggs
Ingredients (serves 2):
4 large eggs

2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for creamier eggs)

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 tablespoon butter or oil

Optional toppings: chopped chives, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, avocado, or hot sauce

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Beat the eggs:
Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add milk or cream (if using), salt, and pepper.

Whisk vigorously until fully combined and slightly frothy — this incorporates air for fluffier eggs.

2. Heat the pan:
Place a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add the butter or oil.

Let the butter melt and coat the pan evenly without browning.

3. Cook the eggs:
Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let it sit undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set.

Gently stir the eggs with a spatula, pushing from the edges toward the center. Continue stirring slowly and gently, forming soft curds.

Cook until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly glossy and moist (they’ll continue cooking slightly off the heat).

4. Serve immediately:
Remove from heat and serve hot. Top with your favorite additions if desired!

📝 Tips & Variations:
Creamier texture: Use cream instead of milk, or add a pat of butter just before removing from heat.

Fluffy eggs: Whisk well before cooking and cook low and slow to avoid overcooking.

Add-ins: Stir in cheese, herbs, or sautéed vegetables near the end of cooking.
