This recipe is for a comforting Chicken and Root Vegetable Pot Pie. It features diced chicken and a medley of root vegetables (Yukon Gold potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery root, parsnip, onion) simmered in chicken stock. The filling is thickened with a milk-flour roux, then combined with peas, parsley, cilantro, and a touch of hot sauce. Individual ramekins are filled with the mixture, topped with puff pastry, and baked until golden brown and bubbly.
