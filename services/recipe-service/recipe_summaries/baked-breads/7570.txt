Gougères are savory French cheese puffs made from a pâte à choux base. The dough is prepared by cooking milk, water, butter, and salt with flour, then vigorously mixing in eggs and grated cheese (like Gruyère or cheddar). Small mounds are baked until golden and puffed, typically served warm, and can be frozen for future baking.
