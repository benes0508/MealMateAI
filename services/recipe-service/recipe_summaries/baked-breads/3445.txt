This recipe makes **Sour Cream Biscuits with Sausage Gravy**. The biscuits are prepared by combining flour, baking powder, and salt with chilled butter, then adding sour cream and milk to form a dough that's rolled, folded, cut, and baked until golden. Concurrently, a creamy white gravy is made by cooking breakfast sausage, then using its drippings to create a roux with butter and flour, to which milk is gradually added and thickened before stirring in the cooked sausage. The hot biscuits are served alongside or topped with the savory gravy.
