This recipe for Linzer Cookies involves making a hazelnut-infused shortbread-like dough, enriched with brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. After chilling, the dough is rolled out and cut into fluted rounds, with half of the cookies having a smaller center cut out. The cookies are baked until golden, then assembled by spreading raspberry jam onto a solid cookie and topping it with a "windowed" one.
