Beef Bourguignonne Pot Pie is a hearty dish featuring beef chuck braised in a rich red wine sauce with bacon, aromatic vegetables (onion, leek, carrot, garlic), herbs (thyme, bay leaf, star anise), crimini mushrooms, and pearl onions. The tender beef stew is then baked until bubbling under a flaky, golden puff pastry crust.
