This recipe details how to make a classic, hearty "Sunday Sauce" (gravy) featuring a combination of meats: browned hot or sweet Italian sausage, pork ribs, and homemade beef braciole (thinly sliced beef rolled with a seasoned breadcrumb mixture). The rich tomato sauce, made from crushed and whole peeled tomatoes, onion, garlic, anchovy, and tomato paste, is simmered for hours with the meats until they are exceptionally tender. The dish is traditionally served with a large tubular pasta, tossed with some sauce and topped with the reserved breadcrumb mixture. It's a flavorful, time-intensive dish ideal for a slow cooking day.
