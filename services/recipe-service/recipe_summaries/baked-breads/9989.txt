This recipe details how to make White Lasagne (Lasagne in Bianco) with a rich Parmigiano Besciamella sauce. The sauce is prepared by saut√©ing shallots, thickening with flour, milk, and chicken stock, then infused with nutmeg, eggs, Marsala, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Layers of this savory sauce are alternated with no-boil lasagne sheets and baked until golden brown.
