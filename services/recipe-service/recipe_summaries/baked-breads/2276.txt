This recipe details how to make Spinach-Artichoke Flatbread Pizzas. Flatbreads are pre-baked, then topped with Alfredo sauce, baby spinach, grape tomatoes, chopped artichoke hearts, and reduced-fat mozzarella. They are baked again until the cheese melts, then finished with a homemade balsamic reduction drizzle.
