A savory Ashkenazic Kartoffel Kugel (potato pudding) made with grated potatoes, onions, eggs, and a matza meal or flour binder. It's baked for about an hour until golden brown. Traditional versions use schmaltz and gribenes, but vegetable oil and grated carrot are offered as alternatives. Best served warm or at room temperature.
