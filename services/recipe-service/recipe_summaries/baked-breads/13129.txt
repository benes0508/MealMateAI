This recipe is for a savory Spinach and Cheese Strata. It involves layering cubed bread with a sautéed spinach and onion mixture, Gruyère, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. This is then covered with a custard made from milk, eggs, and Dijon mustard, and chilled for at least 8 hours to allow the bread to absorb the liquid. Finally, the strata is baked until puffed, golden, and set.
