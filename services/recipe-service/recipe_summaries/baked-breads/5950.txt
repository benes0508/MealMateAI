These Cranberry Hand Pies feature a buttery, flaky crust encompassing a sweet-tart filling made with cranberries, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla. The dough is prepared in a food processor and chilled, while the cranberry filling is cooked on the stovetop and cooled. Individual hand pies are then assembled by rolling out the dough, cutting circles, filling them, sealing the edges, and then baking until golden brown and bubbly.
