This recipe details how to make **Almond Florentine and Black Raspberry Chip Ice Cream Sandwiches**. It involves preparing a **thin, crispy, nutty Almond Florentine cookie** batter from butter, sugar, cream, flour, and sliced almonds, which is cooked on the stovetop before being baked. Once the cookies are cooled, **softened black raspberry chip ice cream** (or other raspberry ice cream) is sandwiched between them, and the completed sandwiches are then frozen until firm. The cookies can be made a day ahead, and the assembled sandwiches frozen for up to two days.
