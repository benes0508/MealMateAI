This recipe features halibut (or hake/cod) fillets coated in a unique crust made from wild rice that is popped like popcorn, then ground into a fine powder. The fish is first dredged in flour, then egg, and finally pressed into the wild rice powder. It's then seared on the stovetop until golden brown, and finished by roasting in the oven until just opaque. Serve with lemon wedges.
