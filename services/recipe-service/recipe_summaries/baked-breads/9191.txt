This recipe for a "Basic Soft White Sandwich Loaf" details how to bake two loaves of soft white bread. It uses a sponge method, combining flour, water, honey, and instant yeast, which is then fermented with additional flour, dry milk, and yeast. The dough is enriched with butter and salt, kneaded thoroughly, and undergoes two rising periods—a bulk fermentation and a final proofing after shaping into loaves. The bread is baked at 350°F with steam for approximately 50 minutes, and ideally brushed with melted butter and cooled completely before slicing.
