Bite-Size Garlic Bread with Fresh Herbs: Toasted rustic sourdough cubes are coated with a richly flavored butter infused with reduced white wine, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and oregano. These bites are briefly re-baked to melt the butter, then garnished with fresh parsley and chives before serving.
