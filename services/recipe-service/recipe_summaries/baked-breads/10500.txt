This recipe is for a savory dressing, combining three types of mushrooms (porcini, button, and shiitake) with crispy prosciutto and rustic rosemary bread cubes. The bread is first toasted, and the mushrooms are saut√©ed with onion, garlic, and rosemary, then deglazed with white wine. These ingredients are then mixed with eggs, green onions, and a liquid blend of porcini mushroom soaking water and chicken broth. The mixture is baked until golden and topped with additional prosciutto and green onions. Components can be prepared a day ahead.
