This recipe details how to prepare Chicken and Mushroom Quesadillas with a Carrot and Mango Slaw. Chicken thighs and mushrooms are roasted with cumin, then sliced and combined with spinach and Monterey Jack cheese inside flour tortillas, which are folded and pan-fried until golden. The quesadillas are served with a fresh slaw made from shaved carrots and mango, dressed with lime and oil, and a creamy yogurt-cilantro sauce.
