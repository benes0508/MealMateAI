This Pimiento Mac and Cheese recipe creates a creamy, savory baked pasta dish. It features a sauce made from simmered red bell peppers, garlic, Peppadew peppers, ancho chiles, extra sharp cheddar, and mozzarella, blended until smooth. Medium shell pasta is mixed with the sauce and mozzarella, then topped with a buttery panko and Parmesan crumb mixture before being baked until bubbling and crisp.
