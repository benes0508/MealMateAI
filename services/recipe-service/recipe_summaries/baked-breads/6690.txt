Patricia's Viennese Crescents are delicate, crescent-shaped cookies made from a dough of ground walnuts, butter, sugar, and flour. The recipe involves preparing homemade vanilla sugar, shaping the dough into crescents, baking them until light golden, and then rolling the warm cookies in the vanilla sugar. Both the vanilla sugar and the baked cookies can be prepared in advance.
