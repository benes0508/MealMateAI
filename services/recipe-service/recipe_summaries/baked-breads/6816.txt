"Baked Hawaiian Islands" is an elaborate tropical dessert featuring a moist coconut cake base layered with a refreshing pineapple-rum sorbet. This is then encased in a fluffy, toasted meringue and garnished with candied macadamia nuts, fresh passion fruit pulp, and lime zest. The recipe involves multiple steps including baking the cake, making the sorbet, preparing the candied nuts, and assembling the frozen, meringue-coated individual desserts which are then briefly baked to toast the meringue.
