This recipe details how to make Georgian Cheese Bread, featuring a yeast-leavened dough enriched with egg. A blend of Havarti and Mozzarella cheeses is encased within the dough, which is then shaped into an 11-inch disk with a distinctive 'X' cut on top to expose the cheese. The bread is baked in a hot oven (500Â°F) until golden, with butter brushed on during the final baking stage.
