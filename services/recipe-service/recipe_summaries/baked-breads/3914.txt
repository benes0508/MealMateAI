This recipe details a low-temperature baked salmon dish featuring a savory country-style or whole grain Dijon mustard and panko breadcrumb crust, enhanced with smoked paprika. It includes roasted asparagus prepared on the same baking sheet. The dish is baked until the salmon is medium-rare and the asparagus is tender, then finished with fresh tarragon.
