This recipe features a Radicchio Salad where sourdough bread is used in two ways: half is baked into crispy croutons, and the other half is blended with garlic, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and olive oil to form a thick, flavorful dressing. The salad is then assembled by tossing radicchio and scallions with the homemade croutons and unique sourdough dressing.
