This recipe is for Potato, Pepper, and Chorizo Empañadas. It involves cooking a savory filling of finely chopped Spanish chorizo, onions, garlic, red and green bell peppers, and Yukon Gold potatoes, seasoned with bay leaf, salt, and oregano. This mixture is then cooled. Empanada dough is divided into pieces, rolled, filled with the cooled mixture, folded, sealed, and crimped. The empanadas are brushed with an egg wash and baked at 400°F for about 25 minutes until golden, then cooled before serving.
