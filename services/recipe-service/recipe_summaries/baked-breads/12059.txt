This recipe details a Caramelized-Onion Pizza with Mushrooms, utilizing a base of frozen pizza dough. The key component is the long, slow caramelization of sliced onions (approximately 40-45 minutes total cook time) until they are deep golden brown and very soft. These are layered over the dough, followed by seasoned cremini mushrooms and crumbled Boursin garlic herb cheese. The pizza is then baked at 475Â°F for 14-16 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese begins to brown.
