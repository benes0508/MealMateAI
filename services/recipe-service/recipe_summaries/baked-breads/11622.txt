**Strawberry and Chocolate Baked Alaska**

This recipe creates individual Baked Alaskas with a chocolate cake base, topped with strawberry ice cream and then encased in a fluffy meringue. The process involves baking small chocolate cakes, topping them with scoops of strawberry ice cream and freezing, then covering the frozen desserts with a Swiss meringue, sealing it to the cake base. Finally, they are briefly baked at a high temperature to brown the meringue before serving.
