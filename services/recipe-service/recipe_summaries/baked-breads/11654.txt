This recipe details how to make a **Zucchini, Bacon, and Gruyère Quiche**. It involves partially pre-baking a pie crust, then cooking bacon and sautéing zucchini separately. An egg custard is made by whisking eggs with a hot cream and milk mixture, then combined with the cooked bacon, zucchini, and grated Gruyère cheese. This filling is poured into the prepared crust and baked until set.
