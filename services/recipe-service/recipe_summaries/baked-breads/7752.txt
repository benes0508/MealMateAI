This recipe details how to create a "Volcano Surprise with Lemon Mousseline Cake," a unique dessert featuring a lemon sponge cake base layered with vanilla ice cream. The cake and ice cream are then encased in a lemon mousseline (souffl√©-like) topping, shaped into a volcano with a lemon shell in the center, and briefly baked to brown the exterior. Cognac is incorporated into the cake and served warm with the finished dessert, creating a dramatic "volcano" effect.
