This recipe details how to make soft ladyfingers, a classic Italian sponge cake biscuit. It involves separating eggs, beating yolks with most of the sugar and flour, then beating whites with the remaining sugar to stiff peaks. The mixtures are gently folded, piped onto a baking sheet, dusted with confectioners sugar, and baked until light golden and springy.
