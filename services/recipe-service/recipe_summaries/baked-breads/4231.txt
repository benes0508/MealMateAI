This recipe details how to make crispy Potato Pancakes (Latkes). It involves grating potatoes and onion, mixing them with flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pepper, and eggs. The pancakes are then shallow-fried until golden, followed by a final bake in the oven to ensure they are cooked through and deeply browned. They are traditionally served with applesauce and sour cream.
