This recipe for **Individual Crispy "Loaded" Pizza** guides you in making six personal-sized pizzas with a homemade, crispy whole wheat crust. The process involves preparing and double-proofing the dough, pre-baking individual crusts on a pizza stone, then topping them with marinara, fresh basil, cremini mushrooms, cooked low-fat turkey sausage, peperoncini, and a mix of reduced-fat mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano, before a final high-heat bake until golden and crispy.
