This recipe features Sheet-Pan Crispy Fish Tacos with Chili-Roasted Corn. Mild fish fillets are coated in a crunchy pumpkin seed and panko crust, then baked on a sheet pan alongside chili-roasted corn. Both components cook simultaneously in the oven at 350Â°F. The fish and corn are served with warm tortillas and traditional taco toppings like cabbage, avocado, cilantro, and lime.
