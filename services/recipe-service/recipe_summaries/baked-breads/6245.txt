This recipe for "Gardener's Pizza" details how to make a homemade yeast-based pizza featuring a variety of fresh vegetables and cheeses. The dough is prepared with bread and whole wheat flour, then refrigerated overnight for flavor and texture. After rising, the dough is stretched and topped with cooked ingredients like cheese, garlic, and some vegetables, then baked at 475°F (240°C) on a pizza stone for 8-10 minutes. It's finished with fresh, raw vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, arugula, corn), herbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, olive oil, salt, and pepper after baking.
