This recipe details how to make a **Peach Galette**, a rustic fruit tart featuring a buttery, flaky pastry crust and a sweet peach filling. The process involves preparing an all-purpose and whole wheat flour dough, chilling it, then assembling it with sliced peaches tossed in sugar, flour, and cinnamon. The edges of the dough are folded over the fruit, brushed with egg wash, sprinkled with turbinado sugar, and baked until golden and bubbly.
