This recipe details how to make Pull-Apart Bread with a pumpkin-infused dough and a savory spinach-pecorino cheese filling. The dough, made with flour, pumpkin purée, milk, yeast, and spices, is kneaded and risen. Meanwhile, a filling of puréed spinach, Pecorino cheese, garlic, butter, and egg is prepared. The risen dough is rolled out, spread with the filling, and rolled into a tube. A unique cutting technique using kitchen shears creates diagonal incisions, shifting segments to form the pull-apart design. The bread is then baked until golden, brushed with butter, and sprinkled with sea salt. Both the dough and filling can be prepared a day in advance.
