"Sara's Santa's Whiskers" is a festive slice-and-bake cookie recipe. The dough is a rich butter cookie base, mixed with red and green candied cherries and pecans. Logs of the dough are rolled in flaked coconut, chilled, then sliced and baked until golden brown. These cookies can be made ahead and stored for up to 3 days.
