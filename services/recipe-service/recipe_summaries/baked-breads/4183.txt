This recipe is for **Gluten-Free Lacy Oat Sandwich Cookies** featuring a rich chocolate and orange liqueur filling. The cookies are made from a blend of gluten-free rolled oats and rice-based flour, combined with a boiled mixture of sugar, cream, brown rice syrup, and butter. Once baked until golden and lacy, they are cooled and then sandwiched with a ganache-like filling made from bittersweet chocolate, heavy cream, brown rice syrup, and orange liqueur. The cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks.
