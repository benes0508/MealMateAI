Adam and Maxine's Famous Latkes are crispy, golden-brown potato pancakes. They are made by grating russet potatoes and onions, thoroughly wringing out excess liquid, then mixing with eggs, breadcrumbs, and seasonings. The mixture is fried in a hot skillet with oil (and optional schmaltz) until cooked through and deeply browned on both sides, then kept warm in the oven. They are traditionally served with applesauce and sour cream.
