This recipe creates **Savory Mushroom and Parmesan Palmiers**, elegant appetizers made from puff pastry. A rich filling of saut√©ed cremini mushrooms, shallots, garlic, herbs (rosemary, thyme, tarragon, bay leaves), white wine, and Marsala is pureed with Parmesan and panko. This mixture is spread onto rolled puff pastry, which is then tightly rolled from both sides towards the center, sliced into heart-shaped palmiers, brushed with oil, and baked until golden and crisp. They can be prepared and baked ahead of time.
