This recipe details how to transform pre-made brioche bretzel dough into "Petits Bonhommes," or little man-shaped breads. After shaping the dough into 10 figures with distinct heads, bodies, arms, and legs, they undergo a second rise, are brushed with an egg wash, and decorated with raisins or other items to create faces and features. Baked until golden brown, they can be left glossy or finished with an optional powdered sugar glaze, and are best served the same day.
