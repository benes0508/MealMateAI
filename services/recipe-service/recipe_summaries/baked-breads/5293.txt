This recipe is for **Skillet Mac and Cheese** with a hidden vegetable twist. It features a creamy cheese sauce made with cheddar, Gruy√®re, and milk, thickened with flour, and seasoned with mustard powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Steamed and finely chopped **cauliflower is incorporated into the sauce** along with wholegrain elbow macaroni. The dish is topped with a breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture and then baked in a skillet until browned and bubbly.
