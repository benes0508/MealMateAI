This recipe is for **Make-Ahead Crispy Chicken Cutlets**. Chicken cutlets are coated in an egg-mayonnaise mixture, then breaded with toasted panko crumbs (seasoned with mustard powder, garlic powder, etc.). The breaded cutlets can be frozen for up to 3 months. They are then baked at 450Â°F until cooked through, taking 10-16 minutes depending on whether they are fresh or frozen.
