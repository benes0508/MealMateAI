This recipe details how to make two Roman-style pizzas featuring roasted cherry tomatoes. It involves preparing a homemade, yeast-risen dough, then roasting cherry or grape tomatoes until their skins split. The stretched dough is topped with olive oil, Parmesan, mozzarella, and the roasted tomatoes, then baked at a high temperature (500Â°F) on a pizza stone until the crust is browned and crisp. Fresh basil is added as a garnish before serving.
