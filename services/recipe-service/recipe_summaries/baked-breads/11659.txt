This recipe is for a **Deep-Dish Wild Blueberry Pie**, featuring a vibrant filling of fresh or frozen wild blueberries, brown sugar, and lemon juice, thickened with tapioca. It's encased in a **double pastry crust** and baked in two stages (initially at 425°F, then 375°F). A crucial step is **cooling the pie completely (about 4 hours)** to allow the filling to properly set.
