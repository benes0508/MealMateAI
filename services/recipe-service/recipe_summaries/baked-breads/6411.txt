This recipe is for a **No-Knead Pizza Dough** that yields 6 portions. It involves whisking flour, salt, and active dry yeast, then stirring in water to form a rough ball. The dough rises at room temperature for about 18 hours until doubled and bubbly. After dividing and shaping into balls, they rest for 1 hour. The dough can be made 3 days ahead and chilled. For baking, the oven is preheated to 500-550Â°F (with a pizza stone or baking sheet). Dough is shaped into 10-12" disks, topped, and baked (broiled on a stone for 5-7 min, or baked on a sheet for ~10 min) until crisp and blistered.
