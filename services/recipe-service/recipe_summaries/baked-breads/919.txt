This recipe details how to make a **Butternut Squash Tarte Tatin** featuring roasted butternut squash layered over a homemade vanilla-butter caramel, topped with a puff pastry crust, and baked until golden. It's served warm, optionally with cinnamon whipped cream. The process involves roasting squash, preparing a caramel base in a springform pan, artfully layering the squash, covering with a pre-rolled puff pastry, then baking in two stages. It can be made ahead and reheated.
