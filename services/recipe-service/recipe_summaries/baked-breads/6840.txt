This recipe for Berry Scones is gluten-free, featuring a dough made from gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and sugar, with chilled diced butter cut in until pea-sized. Frozen cranberries or blueberries are coated in some of the dry mix before being gently folded into the dough with milk. The dough is then patted into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle, cut into 8 triangles, brushed with milk, sprinkled with sugar, and baked at 400Â°F for 15-20 minutes until golden.
