Rhubarb Shortcakes features sweet-tart roasted rhubarb (cooked with red wine and vanilla until syrupy) nestled between homemade, buttery shortcake biscuits. The biscuits are made with a blend of flours, cream, and butter, then baked until golden. The dish is served with whipped cream. Both the rhubarb filling and biscuits can be prepared ahead of time.
