This recipe details how to make a Concord Grape and Pear Pie, featuring a flaky butter and shortening crust. The filling is made by cooking Concord grapes until broken down and juicy, straining the solids, then simmering the strained grape mixture with sliced pears until tender and thickened with cornstarch. The pie is assembled with a bottom crust, filled, and topped with decorative cut-out dough shapes, then baked until golden brown. It requires significant cooling time before slicing.
