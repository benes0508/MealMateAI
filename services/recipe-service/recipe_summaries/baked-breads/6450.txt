This recipe details how to make savory Farmhouse Cheese and Caraway Soda Bread Puddings. It involves a two-step process: first, a caraway-infused soda bread is baked from scratch. Once cooled, this bread is cubed and combined with a rich savory custard made from eggs, milk, sharp white cheddar, and Parmigiano Reggiano. The mixture is then baked in individual ramekins or a larger dish within a hot water bath until set.
