This recipe makes "Spiced Chocolate Molasses Buttons," which are soft, chewy cookies featuring the deep flavors of unsulphured molasses and bittersweet chocolate, complemented by warming spices like cinnamon, ginger, and allspice. The dough is chilled, rolled in turbinado sugar for a crisp coating, baked with an indentation, and then filled with a rich chocolate and molasses ganache. The finished cookies are allowed to set at room temperature.
