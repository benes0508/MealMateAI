This recipe is for **Porcini Popovers**. It involves grinding dried porcini mushrooms into a powder and whisking them with flour, salt, eggs, milk, and melted butter to form a smooth batter, which is then chilled for an hour. The popovers are baked in preheated, buttered popover pans (with additional butter melted in the cups) at 400Â°F until puffed and golden brown (30-35 mins), then pierced and baked further until deep golden brown (5-10 mins). Serve immediately, or reheat later if made ahead.
