This is a savory Wild-Mushroom Bread Pudding. It highlights wild mushrooms (such as chanterelle, cremini, and oyster) saut√©ed with shallots, garlic, and parsley. Toasted brioche or challah bread cubes are combined with this mushroom mixture and soaked in a rich custard made from half-and-half, eggs, and Parmesan. The pudding is then baked in individual ramekins until firm.
