This recipe details how to make a Vidalia Onion Tart with Bacon, Local Honey, and Fresh Thyme. It involves preparing a homemade butter pastry crust, then creating a savory-sweet filling by cooking bacon, saut√©ing Vidalia onions with fresh thyme, seasoning, dry white wine, and local honey, and finally incorporating the cooked bacon, egg, and cream. The tart is assembled by blind-baking the pastry shell, filling it with the cooled onion mixture, and baking until golden and set.
