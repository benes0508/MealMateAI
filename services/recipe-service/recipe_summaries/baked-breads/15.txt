This recipe details how to make a blind-baked pie crust from scratch, using all-purpose flour, chilled unsalted butter, sugar, and salt. The dough is prepared by incorporating cold butter into the dry ingredients, then mixing with ice water, followed by chilling. The rolled-out dough is fitted into a pie dish, crimped, and then blind-baked in two stages: first at 400°F with pie weights, then at 300°F without weights until it's golden brown and fully baked.
