This recipe details how to make Corn Pudding, a savory-sweet dish. It involves pureeing thawed frozen corn with milk, then incorporating egg yolks, sugar, and butter. Flour, salt, and baking powder are folded in, followed by whipped egg whites and shredded cheese (such as Chihuahua, Monterey Jack, or cheddar). The mixture is baked in a 13x9-inch dish, garnished with poblano and red bell pepper strips, until golden brown (about 45 minutes at 350Â°F). Serve warm or at room temperature.
