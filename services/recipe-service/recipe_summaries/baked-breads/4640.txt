Sour Cherry Pie is a classic dessert featuring a flaky crust made with almond flour, all-purpose flour, butter, and egg yolks. The filling consists of sour cherries tossed with granulated sugar, lime zest, and cornstarch. The pie is assembled with a bottom crust and a decorative top crust (or lattice), brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with demerara sugar, then baked at 425°F initially before reducing to 350°F until golden and bubbling. It requires a significant cooling period before serving.
