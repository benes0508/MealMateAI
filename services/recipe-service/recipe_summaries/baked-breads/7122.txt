This recipe is for Pistachio and Dried-Cherry Biscotti, a twice-baked cookie. It combines flour, oats, sugar, leavening, and salt with a wet mixture of eggs, vegetable oil, orange/lemon zest, and extracts. Dried cherries and pistachios are folded in. The dough is shaped into logs, baked until browned, then sliced and baked a second time at a lower temperature until crisp. It can be made up to 3 days ahead.
