"Rustic Bread" is a recipe for a simple, artisan-style bread that uses minimal kneading. It features a long initial chill (12-18 hours) for flavor development, followed by shaping, a secondary long rise (4-12 hours), and high-temperature baking (initial 500°F, then 450°F for 30-40 minutes) until a very brown crust is achieved. Key ingredients are bread flour, salt, and fresh cake yeast.
