**Thymeâ€“Walnut Sandies** are a type of cookie featuring a rich, buttery base made with ground walnuts and a blend of flours, subtly flavored with fresh thyme and sweetened with powdered sugar. These crisp cookies are topped with a vibrant citrus glaze made with orange zest, orange juice, and a hint of thyme, providing a refreshing contrast. The recipe involves preparing a dough log that requires chilling before slicing and baking, followed by icing once cooled.
