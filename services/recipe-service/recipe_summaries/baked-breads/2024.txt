This recipe is for a **White Pizza with Shaved Vegetables and Pesto**. It features a ricotta, mozzarella, and pesto base spread over par-baked pizza dough, topped with thinly shaved zucchini, leeks, asparagus, and peas. The pizza is baked until golden, then finished with fresh watercress, basil, shaved Pecorino, and chopped pistachios for a vibrant, fresh flavor profile.
