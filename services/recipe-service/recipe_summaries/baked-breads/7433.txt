These Glittering Lemon Sandwich Cookies feature a soft lemon-vanilla cookie dough rolled in white and colored sanding sugars, baked until pale and slightly cracked. They are then filled with a tangy-sweet lemon buttercream made from confectioners' sugar, lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, light corn syrup, and butter, piped between two cookies to create a delightful sandwich.
