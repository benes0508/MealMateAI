A recipe for a Pineapple Galette, a rustic, free-form tart featuring a homemade buttery pastry crust filled with fresh pineapple wedges. The fruit is brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with a sugar-cinnamon mix before the dough is folded over the edges and baked until golden and bubbling. Best served warm, optionally with vanilla ice cream.
