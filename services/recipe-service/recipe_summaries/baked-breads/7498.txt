This recipe is for a **Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie**.

**Key Steps:**
1.  **Prepare Filling:** Combine frozen blueberries and cranberries with sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon sticks, lemon juice, and peel in a saucepan. Cook until thickened, then cool completely.
2.  **Assemble Pie:** Roll out one pie crust for the bottom, spoon in the cooled berry filling (after removing cinnamon sticks), then create a lattice top with the second crust.
3.  **Bake:** Brush with cream, sprinkle with nutmeg, and bake at 400Â°F for about 70 minutes until golden and bubbling.
4.  **Serve:** Cool on a rack and serve at room temperature.

**Notes:** The filling can be made 3 days ahead, and the baked pie can stand at room temperature for 8 hours.
