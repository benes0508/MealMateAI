This recipe is for "Crusty Cornstalk Rolls," a unique bread made with active dry yeast, all-purpose flour, and stone-ground yellow cornmeal. The process involves activating yeast, mixing ingredients to form and knead a soft dough, a bulk rise, then shaping the dough into a 12-inch log with diagonal cuts to resemble a cornstalk. After a second proof, the rolls are baked at 425Â°F, with water sprayed into the oven during baking to achieve a characteristic crusty exterior.
