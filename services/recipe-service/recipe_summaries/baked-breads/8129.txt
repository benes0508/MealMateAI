"Lemon Cranberry Florentines" are delicate, crisp cookies made by boiling butter, sugar, cream, and honey to a candy stage, then mixing in almonds, candied lemon peel, cranberries, and flour. The dough is baked into thin, golden rounds, which are then drizzled with melted chocolate and garnished with more lemon peel. They can be prepared up to a week in advance.
