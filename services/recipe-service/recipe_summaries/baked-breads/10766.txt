Cherry Pie is a classic baked dessert featuring a homemade flaky crust and a sweet-tart cherry filling. The crust is made from all-purpose flour, cold butter, and vegetable shortening. The filling combines fresh or frozen pitted sour cherries with sugar, finely ground quick-cooking tapioca, cornstarch, vanilla, and cinnamon. The pie is assembled with a bottom and top crust, then baked at 425°F for 30 minutes, followed by 50-60 minutes at 375°F, until golden and bubbling. It requires 3-4 hours of cooling before serving, often with vanilla ice cream.
