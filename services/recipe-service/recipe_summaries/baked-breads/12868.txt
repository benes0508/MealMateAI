This recipe is for **Polish Apricot-Filled Cookies**, featuring a tender, cream cheese and butter-based dough. The sweet and tangy filling is made from cooked and finely chopped dried apricots, golden raisins, honey, marmalade, and cinnamon. The process involves preparing and chilling both the dough and the fruit filling, then rolling out the dough, cutting it into squares, filling each square, folding opposite corners, and baking until golden.
