**Baked Sardines in Pepperonata** features fresh, deboned sardines baked on a bed of homemade pepperonata. The pepperonata is prepared by broiling red bell peppers, then simmering them with red onion, garlic, tomato paste, white wine, white wine vinegar, parsley, capers, and oregano. The seasoned sardines are laid over this vibrant sauce and baked until firm, then garnished with dill and served with crusty bread.
