This is an impressive vegetarian "vegducken" recipe featuring a hollowed butternut squash stuffed with layers of sweet potato and parsnip. The flavorful mushroom-cranberry-breadcrumb stuffing is made with a garlic-thyme paste and the scooped-out vegetable flesh. The layered vegetable roll is tied with twine, baked until tender, and served in slices with a rich homemade mushroom-shallot gravy.
