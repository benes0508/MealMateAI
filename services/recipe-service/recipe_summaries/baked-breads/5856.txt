This recipe details how to make 12 homemade square biscuits using a mix of all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, with cold butter cut in until pea-sized. Low-fat buttermilk and nonfat plain Greek yogurt are gently stirred in. The dough is lightly shaped into an 8"x 6" rectangle, cut into 12 squares, brushed with buttermilk, and baked at 425Â°F for 15 minutes until puffed and golden.
