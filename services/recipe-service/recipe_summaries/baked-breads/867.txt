This recipe is for Citrus-and-Dill Gravlax, a cured salmon dish. It involves preparing a curing mixture from dill, grapefruit and lemon zest, salt, brown sugar, and peppercorns. This mixture is packed onto a boneless salmon side, wrapped, weighed down, and chilled for 3 days. After curing, the salmon is wiped clean, thinly sliced, and typically served with bagels, cream cheese, red onion, capers, and fresh dill.
