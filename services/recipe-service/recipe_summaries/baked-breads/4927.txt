This recipe is for Pepparkakor, traditional Swedish ginger cookies. It involves combining a spiced flour mixture (ginger, cinnamon, cloves) with a melted mixture of corn syrup, orange zest, butter, sugar, and egg. The dough is then chilled overnight, rolled thin, cut into shapes, sprinkled with pearl sugar, and baked at 375Â°F for 7-8 minutes until the edges are just browned. These cookies can be made ahead and stored for up to 2 weeks or frozen.
