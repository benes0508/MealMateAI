Sheet-Pan Grilled Cheese offers a convenient method for making multiple grilled cheese sandwiches simultaneously. It uses mayonnaise-coated bread and a generous filling of grated cheese. The sandwiches are assembled on one baking sheet, then pressed and cooked under a second preheated baking sheet in a 450Â°F oven, resulting in evenly browned bread and perfectly melted cheese in about 15 minutes.
