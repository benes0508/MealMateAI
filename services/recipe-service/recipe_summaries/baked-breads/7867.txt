This recipe outlines the preparation of homemade Ricotta Gnocchi paired with a simple tomato sauce. The gnocchi dough is made from fresh ricotta, egg yolks, and flour, then rolled into ropes, cut, and optionally shaped. Instructions include refrigerating or freezing the gnocchi. They are cooked by boiling until they float. The accompanying sauce features stewed tomatoes enriched with olive oil and butter. The final dish combines the cooked gnocchi with the sauce, fresh parsley, and seasoning, served with an olive oil drizzle.
