This recipe details a Tourtière du Shack, a traditional French-Canadian meat pie. It features a flaky butter pastry crust enveloping a rich, savory filling made from both slow-braised shredded pork shoulder and seasoned ground pork. The filling is further enhanced with sautéed onions, garlic, mushrooms, reduced white wine, and potato, uniquely spiced with cinnamon and cloves, then baked until golden brown.
