This recipe prepares pan-seared and oven-roasted bone-in rib eye steak accompanied by roasted bone marrow, a fresh radish and herb salad, and toasted country bread. The steak is seasoned, seared to a deep brown, then roasted to desired doneness. Bone marrow is roasted with an anchovy and caper mixture. The vibrant salad combines radishes, celery, and parsley with a lemon-anchovy dressing. The dish is served with pan juices and flaky sea salt.
