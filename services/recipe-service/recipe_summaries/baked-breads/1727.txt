This recipe is for **Tahini Cookies**, a sweet treat featuring the distinct flavor of tahini. The cookies are made by creaming butter, sugar, and honey, then beating in tahini, and finally incorporating dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt). The dough is rolled into balls, topped with toasted sesame seeds, and baked at 350Â°F for 13-15 minutes until golden.
