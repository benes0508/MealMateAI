This recipe is for **Roast Lamb with Marionberry-Pecan Crust**. Lamb racks are seasoned, coated with a sweet-tangy glaze made from marionberry/boysenberry jam and Dijon mustard, then topped with a savory crust of pecans, Italian parsley, and breadcrumbs, drizzled with butter. It's roasted at 425Â°F for about 30 minutes until medium-rare, then cut into chops and served.
