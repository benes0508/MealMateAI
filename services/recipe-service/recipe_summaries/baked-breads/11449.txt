A decadent Apple and Dried Cherry Custard Bread Pudding. This layered dessert features a base of baked Granny Smith apples in a rich Armagnac-caramel sauce with applesauce, topped with custard-soaked white bread and dried cherries. It's baked until golden and puffed, then finished with a crunchy sprinkle of toffee bits and almonds.
