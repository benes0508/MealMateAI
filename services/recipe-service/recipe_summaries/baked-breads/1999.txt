This recipe provides instructions for making safe-to-eat **Edible Cookie Dough** with five different variations. The base dough uses heat-treated flour (baked and cooled) for safety, combined with butter, sugars, milk, and vanilla.

**Variations include:**
1.  **Chocolate Chip:** Simple addition of chocolate chips.
2.  **Cookies and Cream:** Incorporates crushed chocolate sandwich cookies and a touch of oil.
3.  **Rocky Road:** Adds cocoa powder, mini marshmallows, almonds, and chocolate chips.
4.  **Oatmeal Raisin:** Features toasted oats and walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, and oil.
5.  **Peanut Butter:** Blends in peanut butter and is finished with peanut butter cups and chocolate candies.

All variations involve forming the dough into balls and chilling them before serving. The cookie dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 1 month.
