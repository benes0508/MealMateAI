This recipe for Roasted Potato Bread details the process of making a yeast-leavened loaf using a combination of potato and all-purpose flours, buttermilk, and butter. The method involves multiple stages of mixing, kneading, and extended fermentation, including an 18-24 hour cold proof. The loaf is baked until deep golden brown, first in a pan and then directly on the oven rack, before being cooled.
