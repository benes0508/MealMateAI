This recipe is for **Pistachio, Raspberry, and White Chocolate Biscotti**, a classic Italian twice-baked cookie. It features a dough made with flour, sugar, eggs, and almond extract, studded with **pistachios, dried raspberries (or strawberries), and white chocolate chunks**. After being baked twice for crispness, the cooled biscotti are **dipped in melted white chocolate** (with an option for bittersweet chocolate) and then chilled until set.
