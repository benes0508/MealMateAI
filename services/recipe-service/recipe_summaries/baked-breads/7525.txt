M'hanncha, also known as Snake Cake, is a traditional Moroccan dessert featuring a rich, aromatic almond paste flavored with orange, cinnamon, and cardamom. This sweet filling is wrapped in delicate, buttered phyllo dough, then coiled into its distinctive snake-like shape. The pastry is baked until golden and typically finished with a dusting of confectioners' sugar and cinnamon, and garnished with sliced almonds.
