This recipe details how to make Roasted Potato Bread. It involves preparing a yeast-based dough with potato flour, all-purpose flour, buttermilk, and butter. The dough undergoes a long, cold fermentation (18-24 hours) for flavor development, followed by shaping into a loaf and a final rise. The bread is then baked at high temperatures until golden brown and firm, resulting in a savory loaf.
