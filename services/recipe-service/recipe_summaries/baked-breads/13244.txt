This recipe details a Leek, Fennel, and Poppy Seed Tart. Leeks and fennel are roasted until tender, then mixed into a b√©chamel-like sauce made with milk, egg yolks, flour, and Parmesan cheese. This savory filling is then spooned into a thawed puff pastry shell and baked until golden, topped with more Parmesan and poppy seeds. Serve warm.
