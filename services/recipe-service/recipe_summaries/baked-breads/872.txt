This recipe is for homemade **Pimiento Cheese Crackers**. It involves pulsing sharp cheddar, pimiento peppers, flour, and seasonings in a food processor to form a dough, which is then shaped into a log, coated with sesame seeds, and chilled. After chilling, the dough is sliced into thin rounds, pricked with a fork, and baked until golden and crisp.
