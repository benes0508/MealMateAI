This recipe details preparing a Roast Heritage Turkey, featuring a unique bacon-herb butter applied under the skin for flavor and moisture. A rich, multi-day cider gravy is created by first roasting turkey parts, aromatics (celery, onions), and apples with apple cider and vinegar, then simmering with stock. The heritage turkey is slow-roasted over a bed of vegetables and apples, while the gravy is finished by thickening the prepared base with pan drippings. Key preparatory steps include chilling the butter-infused turkey for at least a day and preparing the gravy base in advance.
