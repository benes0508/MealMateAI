This recipe is for **Hazelnut Biscotti**, a twice-baked Italian cookie. It features toasted and chopped hazelnuts (some finely ground with sugar), mixed with self-rising cake flour, eggs, and vanilla to form a dough. The dough is shaped into logs, baked, then sliced and baked a second time until golden and crisp.
