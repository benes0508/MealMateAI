This recipe details how to make a **Coconut Cream Pie** from scratch. It involves preparing a classic butter pie crust, then creating a rich coconut custard filling by infusing milk with toasted coconut, thickening it with egg yolks and cornstarch, and setting it with gelatin. Once cooled, whipped cream is folded into the custard. The pie is assembled by layering toasted coconut and the filling in the baked crust, then chilled until set, and garnished with more toasted coconut before serving.
