This recipe details how to make Classic Beef Meatballs baked in the oven and then finished with tomato sauce. Ground beef is mixed with ricotta cheese, eggs, breadcrumbs, parsley, oregano, salt, red pepper flakes, and ground fennel, then formed into golf-ball sized meatballs. These are roasted in a baking dish until firm, excess grease is drained, and then they are simmered in a classic tomato sauce before serving.
