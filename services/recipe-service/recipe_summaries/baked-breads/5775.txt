Pistachio Cranberry Oatmeal Icebox Cookies are a delightful treat featuring crunchy pistachios, tart dried cranberries, and wholesome oats. The dough, made with butter, sugars, and spices, is prepared using the creaming method, then shaped into logs and chilled for at least four hours. Once firm, the logs are sliced into thin rounds and baked at 350Â°F for 8-10 minutes until golden. They can optionally be garnished with a drizzle of melted chocolate.
