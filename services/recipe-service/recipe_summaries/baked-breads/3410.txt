This recipe details how to make Barley-Stuffed Peppers. It involves cooking barley and saut√©ing cremini mushrooms, then combining them with Parmesan, fresh mozzarella, and parsley. This mixture is used to stuff halved bell peppers (yellow and red), which are then baked until tender, and finished with a topping of breadcrumbs baked until golden.
