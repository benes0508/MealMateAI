This recipe details how to make Cherry Almond Shortbread Cookies. It involves soaking tart cherries in black currant liqueur (cr√®me de cassis), incorporating both ground and chopped almonds into a buttery shortbread dough. The dough is formed into an almond-coated log, chilled, then sliced and baked with a soaked cherry pressed into the center of each cookie.
