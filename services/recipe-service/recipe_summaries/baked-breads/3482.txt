This recipe details how to make an Onion Tart with a homemade pastry shell and a rich, savory filling. The pastry is a simple flour, butter, and water dough that is blind-baked. The filling consists of slowly caramelized brown onions (taking up to an hour), combined with egg yolks, pure cream, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. The tart is assembled by filling the blind-baked pastry with the onion mixture and baking until the filling is set. It can be served warm or at room temperature.
