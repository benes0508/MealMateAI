This recipe details how to make grilled flatbreads topped with savory sweet Italian sausage, sweet and tangy caramelized red onions, and nutty Manchego cheese. Pizza dough is first grilled plain until marked, then topped with the prepared ingredients and returned to the grill until the cheese melts and the crust is crisp.
