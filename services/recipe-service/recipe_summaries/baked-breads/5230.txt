Apple Pithivier is a decorative French puff pastry dessert. It features a homemade apple butter filling (made with apples, butter, sugar, and vanilla) layered over frangipane, encased between two layers of puff pastry. The pastry is sealed, shaped with scalloped edges, egg-washed, and scored with intricate patterns before being baked until golden brown.
