This recipe details how to prepare **Baked Fish and Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic**. It involves oven-baking potato wedges seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and rosemary until tender. A firm-fleshed fish fillet (like grouper or snapper) is then added to the same dish, seasoned with more rosemary, salt, pepper, breadcrumbs, and olive oil, and baked alongside the potatoes for a complete one-pan meal.
