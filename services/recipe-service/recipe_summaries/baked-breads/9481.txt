This recipe for Celery Apple Granita involves making fresh juices from Granny Smith apples (with added vitamin C) and a separate blend of celery and tarragon. The two strained juices are then combined, seasoned with salt and pepper, and frozen in a shallow dish, requiring periodic scraping to achieve the granita texture.
