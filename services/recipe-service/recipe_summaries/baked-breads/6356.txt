Apricot-Anise Tarts are a sweet dessert featuring a tender sweet dough flavored with aniseed, filled with a rich, simmered apricot mixture, and served with a light almond whipped cream. The recipe involves preparing the apricot filling and anise-infused dough separately, then assembling and baking the tarts until golden. Both the filling and the baked tarts can be made ahead of time.
