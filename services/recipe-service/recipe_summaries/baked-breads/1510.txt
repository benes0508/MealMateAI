This recipe creates delicate Hazelnut Lace Sandwich Cookies. The thin, lacy cookies are made by browning butter and combining it with ground hazelnuts, flour, sugar, cream, and maple syrup, then baking until golden. The cookies are then filled with a creamy, vibrant mixture of butter, powdered sugar, blueberry jam, and lime zest.
