This recipe for Assorted Cheddar Crisps details making crispy cheese crackers with three distinct flavors. A base dough of sharp cheddar, butter, flour, and egg yolk is divided, with one portion flavored with black pepper, another with caraway seeds, and the third with nigella seeds. The dough is shaped into logs, chilled, then sliced thin and baked until golden and crisp. The crisps can be served warm or at room temperature.
