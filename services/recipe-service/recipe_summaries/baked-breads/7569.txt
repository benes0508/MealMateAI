Marie-Hélène's Apple Cake is a dense, moist cake featuring a generous amount of apple chunks (ideally four different kinds) folded into a thick batter made with flour, sugar, eggs, dark rum, vanilla, and melted butter. The process involves whisking dry ingredients, preparing a wet mixture, alternating the addition of flour and butter, then folding in the chopped apples. It's baked in a springform pan until golden brown, then cooled and can be served warm or at room temperature, optionally with whipped cream or cinnamon ice cream. It keeps well, uncovered, for about two days.
