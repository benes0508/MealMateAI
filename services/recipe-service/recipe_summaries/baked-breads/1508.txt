This recipe details how to make Honey-Vanilla Linzer Cookies. It involves shaping honey-vanilla sablé dough into a triangle, freezing it, then thinly slicing it. Half the cookies have their centers punched out before baking at 325°F for 10-15 minutes. Once cooled, they are assembled by spreading jam on the solid cookies and topping them with powdered sugar-dusted cutout cookies. The baked cookies can be prepared up to 2 days in advance (unassembled) and stored at room temperature.
