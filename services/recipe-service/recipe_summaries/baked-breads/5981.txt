This recipe details how to make a rich, silky turkey gravy from scratch. It involves three main steps: first, preparing a homemade turkey stock by roasting turkey wings and neck with vegetables and herbs, then simmering; second, creating a golden-brown roux from butter and flour for thickening; and finally, combining the strained turkey stock with roast turkey drippings and the prepared roux, simmering until the gravy is thick and flavorful.
