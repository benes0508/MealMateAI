This recipe details how to make Cilantro-Lime Chicken Fajitas with Grilled Onions. It involves marinating chicken breast strips along with poblano chiles, bell peppers, and red onions in a zesty cilantro-lime sauce seasoned with cumin and ancho chile powder. Both the chicken and vegetables are then grilled, and warm tortillas are used to assemble the fajitas, which are served with a drizzle of the reserved marinade and optional toppings like salsa or guacamole.
