This recipe details how to make an "Easiest Peach-Raspberry Pie" featuring a simple press-in butter crust and a separate crumb topping. The crust is made from flour, butter, salt, and sugar, with a portion reserved for the cinnamon-spiked crumb topping. The filling combines fresh peaches, raspberries, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt. The pie is baked in two stages: initially at 425°F for 20-25 minutes, then at 350°F for 35-45 minutes, until golden and bubbling. A minimum 2-hour cooling time is required for the juices to set. The crust and crumb topping can be made and frozen up to 3 months in advance.
