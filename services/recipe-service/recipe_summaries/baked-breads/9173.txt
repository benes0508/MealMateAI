This recipe details how to bake a **Basic Sourdough Bread** using a multi-stage stiff sourdough starter, spanning approximately two days. The process begins with feeding and expanding the starter over 14 hours, followed by mixing and kneading the dough (by hand or mixer) with bread flour, water, and salt. The dough undergoes a bulk fermentation (4-5 hours) with two "business letter turns" to develop structure, then is shaped and proofed in a banneton (3-4 hours). Finally, the bread is baked at high temperatures (initial 475°F, then 450°F) on a preheated stone with added steam for a crisp crust, and cooled on a wire rack. The recipe provides key ratios (100% flour, 68% water, 30% dough starter, 2% salt) and notes variations for quicker baking (with commercial yeast) or altered flavor.
