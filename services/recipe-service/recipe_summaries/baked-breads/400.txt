This recipe is for "Black-and-White-and-Green Cookies," featuring a unique twist on the classic. The "green" comes from fresh mint infused directly into the cookie dough. After baking, the cookies are decorated with coarse sanding sugar for a "white" sparkly edge, and then partially coated with a glossy "black" cocoa glaze, creating a visually striking cookie with a refreshing mint flavor.
