This recipe details how to make a Fresh Peach Crostata, a rustic fruit tart. It involves peeling and slicing fresh peaches, then combining them with a crumbly mixture of sugar, flour, Earth Balance (a vegan butter substitute), nutmeg, and almond extract. This filling is arranged on a rolled-out flaky pastry dough, with the edges folded inward to form a free-form crust. The crostata is baked at 325Â°F for about 50 minutes until golden and bubbly, and can be served hot, warm, or at room temperature.
