It's flavored with Dijon mustard, barbecue sauce, and horseradish, and bound with eggs, milk, and bread crumbs. Unique elements include a crouton base and croutons pressed into the loaf, along with whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs baked on top for infused flavor and texture. The meatloaf is baked until browned and cooked through.
