This recipe is for **Chocolate-Dipped Spritz Washboards with Pistachios**, a type of cookie. It involves modifying a basic buttery sugar cookie dough by substituting confectioners' sugar for granulated and almond extract for vanilla, and omitting the egg. The dough is then piped into 3-inch strips using a cookie press, chilled, and baked until lightly golden. Once cooled, half of each cookie is diagonally dipped in melted bittersweet chocolate and sprinkled with finely chopped salted pistachios, then allowed to set.
