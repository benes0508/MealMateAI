Sweet Potato Sonker with Milk Dip is a traditional Southern dessert featuring a two-part preparation. The sonker involves making a flaky pie crust from scratch (flour, butter, egg, vinegar), which is used for both the bottom and a lattice top. The filling consists of boiled, thinly sliced sweet potatoes layered in the crust, then topped with a mixture of sugar, sorghum syrup, flour, butter, and reserved potato cooking liquid.

Concurrently, a creamy milk dip is prepared by simmering milk, sugar, and cornstarch until thickened, then flavoring with vanilla. The sonker is partially baked, then drenched with a portion of the milk dip and baked further until caramelized. It's served warm, with the remaining milk dip on the side.
