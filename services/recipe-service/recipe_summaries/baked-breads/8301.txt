This recipe for **Herb and Cheese Poppers** creates savory, flaky biscuit-like bites. It involves grating frozen butter into a flour mixture, then layering and folding the dough with a sharp cheddar and fresh herb (parsley, basil, thyme, sage) blend. The dough is folded multiple times, rolled, and cut into 36 small pieces, which can be frozen for later. They are baked at 500Â°F for about 10 minutes until golden.
