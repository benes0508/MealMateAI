This recipe details how to make a **Lattice-Crust Pear Pie**. It involves preparing a filling of sliced Bartlett or Anjou pears tossed with flour, sugar, nutmeg, and lemon juice. A bottom crust is fitted into a pie plate, and the remaining pastry dough is cut into strips to form a decorative lattice top. The pie is brushed with milk, sprinkled with sugar, and baked in two stages (initial high heat, then lower) until golden brown and the filling is bubbling, then cooled.
