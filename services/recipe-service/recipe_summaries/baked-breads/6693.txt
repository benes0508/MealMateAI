Lauren's Peanut Butter Kiss Cookies are classic baked cookies combining peanut butter, brown sugar, and vanilla/almond extract. After baking for 8-10 minutes, a chocolate kiss is pressed into the center of each cookie, creating their signature look and taste. Yielding approximately 30 cookies, they can be prepared ahead and stored for up to 3 days.
