This recipe details a **Stuffed Pork Tenderloin with Mustard-Caper Sauce**. A pork tenderloin is butterflied and filled with a savory mixture of cooked bacon, garlic, spinach, and mustard, alongside hard-boiled egg quarters. After being rolled, tied, seared, and roasted to an internal temperature of 150Â°F, the tenderloin is completely chilled. It's then sliced and served cold or at room temperature with a tangy sauce made from sieved hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, coarse grain mustard, lemon juice, and capers, ideally accompanied by crusty bread.
