This recipe details how to make a classic apple pie, featuring a homemade, flaky butter crust prepared with a food processor and a touch of apple cider vinegar. The filling uses a blend of Honeycrisp, Braeburn, or Golden Delicious apples, seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. The pie is baked in a two-stage process (high then low heat) for a golden crust and bubbly filling, requiring significant cooling time for the juices to set. Make-ahead options for the dough and storage tips for the baked pie are also included.
