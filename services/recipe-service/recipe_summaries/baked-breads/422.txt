This recipe creates flavorful Chickpea-Mushroom Burgers using a base of quinoa, browned chickpeas, crimini mushrooms, tahini, and miso for umami. The patties are formed, frozen for firming (and can be stored up to 3 months), then baked until crisp. Serve on buns with cheese, mayonnaise, mustard, lettuce, and pickles. Vegan cheese is an option.
