This recipe is for **White Soda Bread**, made with all-purpose flour, buttermilk, baking soda, and salt, with optional caraway seeds. The dough is quickly mixed, lightly kneaded, shaped into a round, scored with an 'X' on top, and then baked at 425Â°F for about 35 minutes until golden brown. It's cooled completely before serving.
