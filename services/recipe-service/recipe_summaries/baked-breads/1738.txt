This recipe details a classic meatloaf combining ground beef and pork with milk-soaked breadcrumbs and saut√©ed aromatics like onion, celery, and garlic. The mixture is seasoned with Worcestershire, eggs, salt, and pepper, formed into a loaf, brushed with ketchup, and baked until fully cooked, then rested before slicing.
