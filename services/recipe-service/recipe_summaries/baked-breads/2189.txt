This recipe details how to make a **Cauliflower-Crust Pizza** topped with marinara sauce and mozzarella. The gluten-free crust is created by ricing and squeezing cauliflower, then mixing it with egg, Parmesan, and almond meal. The crust is pre-baked until firm, then topped and baked again until bubbly. It's a healthier pizza option and can be made up to three days in advance.
