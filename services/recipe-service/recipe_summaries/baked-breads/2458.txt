This recipe for "Bite-Size Stollen (Stollenkonfekt)" creates miniature versions of the traditional German Christmas bread. The dough combines creamed butter and sugar with quark, lemon, vanilla, rum, flour, a blend of spices (cinnamon, cloves, cardamom), almonds, and raisins. Shaped into small ovals and baked until golden, the warm Stollen bites are then dipped in melted butter and coated in confectioners' sugar. For best flavor, they should rest for 1-4 days before serving and can be stored for up to 3 weeks.
