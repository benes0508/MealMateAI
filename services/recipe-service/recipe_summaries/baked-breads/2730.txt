This recipe provides instructions for making Naan, an Indian flatbread. It involves a yeast-leavened dough made with white bread and all-purpose flours, yogurt, and water. Key steps include activating yeast, kneading the dough until smooth, a 3-4 hour rise (or up to 2 days refrigerated), shaping the dough into rounds, and cooking them in a hot cast-iron skillet until puffy and browned. The naan is then brushed with ghee and garnished with cilantro. A quicker, no-yeast variation using baking powder and soda is also included.
