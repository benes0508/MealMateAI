This recipe details how to prepare a **Roast Beef Tenderloin with Caesar Crust**. A large beef tenderloin is seasoned, chilled overnight, then brought to room temperature. A flavorful Caesar-style crust mixture (breadcrumbs, Parmesan, mayonnaise, anchovies, Dijon, lemon zest, Worcestershire, garlic, and black pepper) is prepared and spread generously over the tenderloin. It's then roasted at 400°F until the crust is golden and the internal temperature reaches desired doneness (110-125°F), followed by a 20-minute rest before slicing.
