This recipe guides you through making homemade Blueberry Jam Sandwich Cookies. It involves first preparing a fresh blueberry jam with pectin, which requires chilling. A rich butter cookie dough, flavored with lemon peel, is then made, chilled, and sliced. Half of the cookies are sprinkled with raw sugar before baking. Once baked and cooled, the plain cookies are filled with the homemade jam and topped with the sugared cookies.
