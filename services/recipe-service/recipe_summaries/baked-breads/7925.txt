This recipe details how to make **Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken**. Chicken pieces are first marinated for at least 6 hours in a buttermilk, herb, and spice mixture, then "double-dipped" in a seasoned flour coating for extra crispiness. Finally, the chicken is deep-fried to a golden brown and cooked through, with options for serving immediately or reheating.
