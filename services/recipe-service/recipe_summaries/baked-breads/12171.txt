This is a classic French *Paris-Brest*, a circular choux pastry ring filled with a rich hazelnut cream. The filling combines homemade hazelnut praline "butter" with velvety pastry cream and light whipped cream. The baked choux pastry is then halved, generously filled, and garnished with reserved crushed praline and a dusting of confectioners' sugar.
