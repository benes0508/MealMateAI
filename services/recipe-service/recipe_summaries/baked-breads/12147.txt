**Escargots à la Bourguignonne** is a classic French appetizer featuring snails baked in their shells. A rich garlic-parsley butter, enhanced with shallots and white wine, is divided between the shells, stuffed with a snail, and topped with more butter. The shells are nestled in salt and baked at 450°F until the butter is melted and sizzling, typically served immediately with French bread.
