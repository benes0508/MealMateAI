This recipe is for Savory Parmesan Shortbread Rounds, a savory cookie-like snack. It involves blending flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, minced garlic, and cayenne pepper with chilled butter to form a dough. The dough is shaped into logs, cut into rounds, pressed flat, and topped with more Parmesan. These are then baked at 350Â°F for about 20 minutes until golden. They can be made ahead and stored at room temperature or frozen.
