This recipe details how to make Mole Coloradito, a rich and complex sauce. It involves roasting and pureeing a base of tomatoes, tomatillos, onion, and garlic. Separately, ancho and guajillo chiles are toasted, rehydrated with raisins, and then blended. Aromatic spices (cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cumin) are finely ground along with toasted sesame seeds. All these pur√©es and spices are then combined and simmered with chicken broth for an extended period (over 90 minutes total), with bittersweet chocolate, breadcrumbs, and piloncillo (or dark brown sugar) added towards the end to achieve a thick, flavorful sauce.
