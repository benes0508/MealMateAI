This recipe is for **Pecan Sandies**, buttery shortbread-style cookies. It involves creaming butter with powdered sugar, then mixing in flour and coarsely chopped pecans. The dough is formed into 2-inch disks and baked until pale golden at 325°F (convection) or 350°F (standard) for 15-25 minutes. Optionally, they can be dusted with more powdered sugar after cooling. They can be stored for up to 3 days.
