This recipe is for **Plain Bagels**, a classic baked good known for its chewy interior and slightly crisp, shiny crust. It involves making a yeast-based dough with high-gluten flour and a touch of malt powder, followed by an overnight cold fermentation for flavor development. The bagels are then shaped, briefly boiled in honey water for their distinctive texture and sheen, and finally baked at a high temperature until golden brown.
