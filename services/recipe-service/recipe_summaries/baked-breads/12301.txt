This recipe provides instructions for a **Citrus Tart**, a baked dessert featuring a buttery, flaky pastry shell and a tangy, smooth custard filling. The tart shell is prepared using a food processor, chilled, and then blind-baked. The filling is a whisked mixture of fresh orange and lemon zest and juice, eggs, sugar, and heavy cream, which is then poured into the pre-baked shell and baked until just set. The tart is cooled completely to allow the filling to firm up.
