BA's Best Eggplant Parmesan is a multi-step recipe featuring a rich, slow-roasted tomato sauce and layers of salted and pressed eggplant slices, breaded in a panko-Parmesan mixture, and pan-fried until golden. These are then layered with the homemade sauce and a blend of low-moisture and fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, and fresh herbs. The dish is baked in stages, first covered until custardy, then uncovered to brown and bubble the cheese. It emphasizes a creamy eggplant texture and a deeply flavorful sauce, with components and the finished dish capable of being made ahead.
