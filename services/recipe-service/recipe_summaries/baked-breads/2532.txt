This recipe creates a rich Apple and Fig Custard. It involves pre-roasting apple slices with browned butter and demerara sugar until caramelized, then arranging them with fresh figs in a baking dish. A frothy custard base, made in a blender with eggs, milk, apple brandy, crème fraîche, flour, and a fragrant blend of granulated sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla bean seeds, is poured over the fruit. The dish is then baked until golden and set.
