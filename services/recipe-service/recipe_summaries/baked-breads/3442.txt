This recipe details how to make D.I.Y. Apple Mille-Feuille, a layered dessert. It involves baking flattened puff pastry squares until golden, roasting thinly sliced apples with maple syrup, bourbon, and spices until tender, and preparing a bourbon-spiked whipped cream. Guests then assemble individual servings by layering the crispy pastry, warm apples, and whipped cream, finished with a drizzle of maple syrup.
