This "Parisian" recipe describes how to make a gourmet mushroom and truffle pizza. It uses a master dough with starter, topped with sautéed assorted mushrooms (pioppini, oyster, shiitake, trumpet), part-skim mozzarella, and baked on pizza stones at 500°F. The finished pizza is garnished with truffle paste, Saint André cheese, Comté cheese, arugula, and a drizzle of olive oil.
