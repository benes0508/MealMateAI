This recipe describes how to make Chai-Spiced Monkey Bread, a sweet, pull-apart bread. It involves preparing a yeast dough, shaping it into small balls, then coating them in a fragrant mixture of sugar and chai spices (cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, cardamom, cloves). These spiced dough balls are layered in a Bundt pan with toasted pecans and pumpkin seeds, then topped with caramel sauce before being baked until golden and sticky.
