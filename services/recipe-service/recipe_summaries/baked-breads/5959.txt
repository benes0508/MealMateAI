This recipe for "Cornbread, Sausage, and Pecan Dressing" creates a savory, herb-filled Thanksgiving-style side dish. It involves drying cornbread pieces, browning breakfast sausage, then saut√©ing onions and celery with butter and deglazing with apple cider vinegar. These components are combined with chicken broth, fresh herbs (parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme), and optional pecans. Finally, eggs and more broth are folded in before baking until set and golden brown. The dish can be prepared a day ahead.
