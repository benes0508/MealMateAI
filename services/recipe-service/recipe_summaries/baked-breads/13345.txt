This recipe details making Goat Cheese and Herb Souffles. It involves preparing individual soufflé dishes with butter and Parmesan. A savory base is created by sautéing red onion with thyme and rosemary, then adding flour, milk, and egg yolks, thickened into a roux. Goat cheese, salt, pepper, and cayenne are then whisked into this base. Stiffly beaten egg whites are gently folded in, along with remaining goat cheese and Parmesan. The mixture is divided into dishes and baked at 350°F for about 20 minutes until puffed and golden, then served immediately.
