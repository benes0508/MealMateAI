This recipe details how to make Traditional Soft Pretzels, featuring a dough made with active dry yeast, bread flour, Pilsner beer, butter, and salt. Key steps include an optional long cold fermentation (8-24 hours) for optimal flavor, shaping the dough into classic pretzel twists, and a crucial dip in either a food-grade lye or baked baking soda solution before baking. The pretzels are baked at a high temperature (500Â°F) until they achieve a deep mahogany color, resulting in a classic chewy interior and crisp crust. They are best enjoyed fresh but can be stored or frozen and reheated.
