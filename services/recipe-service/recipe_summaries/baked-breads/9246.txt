This French Bread Pudding recipe uses stale French bread soaked in milk, then combined with eggs, sugar, vanilla, and dried cherries. It's baked at 325Â°F for about 70 minutes until golden brown, cooled, and ideally refrigerated overnight before reheating. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with heavy cream.
