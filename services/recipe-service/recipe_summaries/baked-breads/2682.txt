This recipe details how to make Blondie Sundaes featuring three main components: **Blondies**, **Fried Walnuts**, and **Candied Fennel**.

**Blondies** are prepared by browning butter, then mixing it with sugar, eggs, and a blend of buckwheat and almond flours, baked until set, and cut into bars.

**Fried Walnuts** are made by toasting raw walnuts, then steeping them in a sugar syrup for at least 12 hours before coating them in powdered sugar and deep-frying until crisp.

**Candied Fennel** involves simmering thinly sliced fennel with lemon zest and a vanilla bean in the reserved sugar syrup from the walnuts until translucent and tender.

Finally, the sundae is assembled by topping scoops of vanilla gelato or ice cream with pieces of the blondies, the fried walnuts, the candied fennel, and optional ground cherries and fennel fronds. Several components can be prepared up to two days in advance.
