This recipe describes how to make individual duck pizzas with an Asian flair. Duck breast is seasoned with five-spice, seared, and then baked until rare before being thinly sliced. Whole wheat pizza dough is formed into small disks, brushed with hoisin sauce, and topped with spinach, mozzarella, bell pepper, and the sliced duck. These are then baked until bubbly and garnished with scallions and black sesame seeds.
