This recipe details how to make Double Chocolate Rye Cookies, combining melted bittersweet and unsweetened chocolates with toasted walnuts and rye flour. The process involves whipping eggs and sugar, then folding in the chocolate mixture, dry ingredients (rye flour, baking powder, salt), and a mix of chopped and shaved chocolates with walnuts. A critical step is chilling the dough for at least 3-4 hours (or overnight) before baking at 350Â°F for 10-12 minutes until the cookies are cracked at the edges and soft in the center.
