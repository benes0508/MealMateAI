This recipe details a unique Thanksgiving dressing baked inside a whole pumpkin. The savory bread-based stuffing incorporates rehydrated dried apricots and prunes (soaked in apple juice) for a sweet-tart contrast, along with traditional aromatics like onion, celery, and sage. The pumpkin is pre-steamed and seasoned internally before being filled with the dressing and baked until tender.
