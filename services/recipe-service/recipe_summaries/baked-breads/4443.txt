This "Pizza Bianca" recipe creates a flavorful Italian flatbread with a simple, wet, and sticky yeast dough. Prepared in a food processor, the dough undergoes a long rise before being stretched, topped with olive oil and fresh rosemary, and baked at a high temperature (500Â°F) on a preheated pizza stone until golden and crispy. It's finished with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of coarse sea salt.
