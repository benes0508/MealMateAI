This recipe details how to make French Bread using a food processor for mixing. Key ingredients include unbleached all-purpose flour, active dry yeast, warm water, salt, and a touch of distilled white vinegar for texture. The process involves two rises (one in the processor bowl, one shaped), shaping the dough into loaves, and baking at 450Â°F, starting with steam and finishing directly on the rack for a golden, crusty exterior.
