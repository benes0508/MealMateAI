Pumpkin-Pear Crisps are individual baked desserts featuring a spiced fruit filling of tender pumpkin (or butternut squash) and pears, sweetened with maple syrup and brown sugar. They are topped with a buttery, crispy streusel made from toasted oats, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, and brown sugar. The dish is assembled in ramekins and baked until bubbling, then served warm topped with the streusel.
