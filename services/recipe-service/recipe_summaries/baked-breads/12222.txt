This recipe details how to make **Dried Cranberry, Walnut, and Lemon Scones**. The dough is prepared by rubbing chilled butter into a flour base with sugar, lemon peel, dried cranberries, and walnuts. It's moistened with half-and-half and lemon juice, then shaped into rounds, cut into wedges, and brushed with a lemon-sugar glaze. The scones are baked at 375Â°F for about 18 minutes until golden, and can be served warm or at room temperature.
