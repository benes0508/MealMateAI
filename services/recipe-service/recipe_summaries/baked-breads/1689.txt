This recipe details how to make a "No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust" from scratch. It involves combining flour, sugar, and salt with cold butter cubes (specifically mashed flat, not finely cut), then briefly kneading in cold water to form a dough. The dough is rolled, folded to create layers, shaped into two 9-inch pie crusts, and then thoroughly chilled. Finally, the crusts are blind-baked at 350Â°F with sugar as a weight until golden brown and fully set, ready for filling once cooled.
