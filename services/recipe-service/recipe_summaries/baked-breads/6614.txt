This recipe features a pizza with a whole grain spelt crust, topped with a creamy sour cream and caper spread, thinly sliced apples, fennel, and prosciutto. The dough is made, rested, and then rolled out and layered with the toppings before being baked on a hot stone until golden and crisp. It's finished with fresh green onions.
