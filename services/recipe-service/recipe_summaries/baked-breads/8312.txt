Cranberry-Nut Rolls are sweet, yeast-leavened bread rolls featuring a soft dough enriched with toasted walnuts and dried cranberries. The dough is prepared using a stand mixer, kneaded, and undergoes a double-rise process for a light texture. Before baking, the rolls are brushed with an egg glaze and sprinkled with raw sugar for a golden finish. Baked until golden, they are ideal for breakfast, snacks, or a sweet side, and can be frozen for later enjoyment.
