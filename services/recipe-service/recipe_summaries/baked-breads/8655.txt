These Double Ginger Cookies feature a blend of all-purpose and whole wheat flours, incorporating both ground and minced crystallized ginger for a rich, spicy flavor. The recipe uses applesauce, canola oil, and ground flaxseed for moisture, along with lemon zest and juice for brightness. The dough requires chilling before being rolled in sugar, flattened, and baked until lightly browned.
