This recipe details how to bake Rye Dinner Rolls featuring a unique crisp topping. It involves preparing a yeast dough with unbleached all-purpose and rye flours, which undergoes two rising periods. Separately, a thin rye-crisp dough is made, rolled into small rounds, and brushed with egg white. These crisp rounds are then placed atop the risen dinner rolls, which are also brushed with egg white, before baking at 425Â°F for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
