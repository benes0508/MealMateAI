This recipe is for Challah, a traditional braided bread. It involves activating yeast with warm milk and honey, then combining it with flour, oil, eggs, and salt to form a dough. The dough is kneaded, allowed to rise until doubled, then shaped into braided loaves. After a second rise, the loaves are brushed with an egg wash, sprinkled with seeds, and baked at 350Â°F until golden brown.
