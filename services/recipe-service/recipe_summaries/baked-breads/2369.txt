This recipe details how to make festive gingerbread cookies shaped like letters. The chilled gingerbread dough is rolled, cut into desired letter shapes (using stencils or cookie cutters), and then baked. Once cooled, the cookies are dipped in melted white chocolate, styled with a toothpick to create 'icicle' designs, and sprinkled with white sanding sugar for a snowy effect.
