This recipe details how to make a **Winter Squash Soufflé**. It involves creating a savory-sweet base with winter squash purée, Swiss cheese, brown sugar, cayenne, and nutmeg, thickened with a béchamel sauce. Egg yolks are then whisked in, and the mixture is lightened by carefully folding in stiffly beaten egg whites before being baked at 425°F until puffed and golden brown.
