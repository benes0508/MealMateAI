This recipe is for Peanut Tuiles, thin, crispy cookies. They are made from a cooked batter of butter, sugar, corn syrup, cream, flour, and salt, with chopped salted peanuts stirred in. The batter is dropped in small amounts onto a lined baking sheet, baked until golden, then quickly rolled around a wooden spoon handle while still warm to achieve their signature curved shape.
