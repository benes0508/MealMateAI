This recipe describes how to make a **Honey-Pecan Tart with Chocolate Glaze**. It involves preparing a rich filling by boiling pecans, sugar, honey, cream, and milk, then cooling it. Pastry dough is rolled out for the base and top crust. The tart is assembled by spreading the pecan filling in the bottom crust, topping it with the second dough round, and baking until golden. Finally, a chocolate glaze is made from bittersweet chocolate and cream, poured over the cooled tart, and garnished with shaved pecans.
