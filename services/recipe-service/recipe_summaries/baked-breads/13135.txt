This recipe for "One-a-Day Baguette" is a classic bread preparation. It involves activating yeast in warm water, then combining it with flour, salt, and sugar to form a dough. The dough is kneaded, allowed to rise until doubled, then shaped into a long, slender baguette. After a second rise, the loaf is scored, brushed with water, and baked at 400Â°F for 30 minutes until golden, then cooled. The recipe notes it can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead and chilled before the final bake.
