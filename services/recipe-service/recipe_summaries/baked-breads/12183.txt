Seven-Layer Cookies are an elaborate confection featuring three distinct, thin almond cake layers (red, white, green) baked individually. These are then stacked with apricot preserves, heavily chilled for stability, and finally coated on both sides with bittersweet chocolate before being trimmed and cut into small, colorful cookies. Key ingredients include almond paste, butter, eggs, and food coloring.
