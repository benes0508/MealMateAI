Turkey Croquettes are crispy, pan-fried patties made from a savory mixture of cooked turkey (or rotisserie chicken), mashed potatoes, and stuffing. They are coated in toasted bread crumbs and served hot, typically with cranberry sauce and/or warm turkey gravy. This recipe is suitable for using up leftovers and can be prepared ahead and frozen.
