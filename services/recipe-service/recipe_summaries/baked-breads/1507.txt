Pistachio Thumbprints are sweet thumbprint cookies featuring a honey vanilla sabl√© dough base rolled in chopped pistachios, then baked. Once cooled, they are filled with a creamy, whipped mixture of sweetened pistachio paste and butter. The cookies can be baked up to 3 days ahead (unfilled) or filled 1 day ahead.
