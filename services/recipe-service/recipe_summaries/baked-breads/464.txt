This recipe provides instructions for making two blind-baked pie crusts from scratch. It involves mixing flour, sugar, and salt with chilled butter (smashed into disks), then adding ice water to form a shaggy dough. The dough is shaped, transferred to a pie dish, trimmed, crimped, and thoroughly chilled. The crust is then blind-baked in a two-stage process: initially with pie weights at 400°F until golden, then without weights at 300°F until evenly browned.
