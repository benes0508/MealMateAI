Toasted-Flour Sabl√©s are delicate, buttery French shortbread cookies. They are uniquely prepared by toasting the flour before use, which imparts a nutty depth, and include sieved hard-boiled egg yolks for an exceptionally tender crumb. The dough is chilled as a log, then sliced and baked until golden at the edges.
