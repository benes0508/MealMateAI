An Apple-Almond Turnover featuring tender, roasted Pink Lady apples (sweetened with brown sugar and vanilla) and almond paste encased in flaky puff pastry. The apples are first roasted until syrupy, then assembled within the pastry and baked until puffed and golden brown. It's a sweet dessert, often served warm with vanilla ice cream.
