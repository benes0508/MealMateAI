Lentil Croquettes are savory patties made from cooked lentils, oatmeal, and seasonings, blended into a paste. This mixture is then formed into ovals, dredged in seasoned flour, egg (optional), and breadcrumbs, and finally baked until crispy. They are best served hot, often with a sauce, or as a leftover in buns.
