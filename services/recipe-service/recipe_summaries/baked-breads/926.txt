This is a savory baked strata featuring sourdough bread, sautéed crimini mushrooms, leeks, and wilted kale. It's bound by an eggy custard with whole milk and Dijon mustard, generously layered with Gruyère and Parmesan cheeses, then baked until golden brown. Ideal for brunch or a comforting make-ahead meal.
