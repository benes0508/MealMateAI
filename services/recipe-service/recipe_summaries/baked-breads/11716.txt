This recipe for **Garlic Knots** uses thawed frozen pizza dough, which is rolled out, cut into strips, and tied into knots before being baked until golden. While baking, a savory mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, and salt is prepared. The warm knots are then tossed in this garlic oil and finished with fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. They can be served warm or at room temperature.
