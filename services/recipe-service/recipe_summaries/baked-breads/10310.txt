This recipe is for **Salted Praline Langues de Chat**, which are crispy, delicate French "cat's tongue" cookies. They feature a homemade, finely chopped salted almond praline sprinkled on top during baking, combined with a thin, piped butter cookie base. The cookies are thin, elongated, and crisp up as they cool.
