This recipe is for an Apple Galette, a rustic open-faced apple tart. It involves preparing a simple butter-based dough, chilling it, then rolling it out. Apple slices, mixed with sugar and lemon peel, are arranged over apricot preserves on the dough. The edges of the dough are folded over the apples. The galette is baked at two temperatures (450°F then 375°F) until golden, then served warm or at room temperature.
