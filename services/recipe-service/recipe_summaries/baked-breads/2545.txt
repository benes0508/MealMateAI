This recipe describes making an Apple-Cranberry Crisp with an Oatmeal-Cookie Crumble. It involves preparing a butter-based crumble with flour, oats, brown sugar, and almonds, which is briefly frozen. A filling of sliced apples and cranberries is tossed with sugar, flour, orange zest/juice, and spices. The crisp is assembled by layering the fruit in a baking dish, topping with the crumble, then baked at 350Â°F for about an hour until golden and bubbling. Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
