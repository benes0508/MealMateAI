This recipe for Salted Apple Pretzel Pie features a unique yeast-based pretzel dough, made with beer, forming both the pie's base crust and decorative pretzel topping. A classic apple filling, cooked with sugar, spices, and lemon juice, is added to the pre-baked crust. The pretzel elements are treated with a baking soda solution and egg wash, then sprinkled with coarse salt, before the entire pie is baked to golden perfection.
