This recipe details how to make **Cheese Animal Crackers** from scratch. It involves pulsing Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, then combining it with flour, baking powder, salt, butter, milk, and egg to form a dough. The dough is chilled, then rolled out thinly and cut into animal shapes using cookie cutters. These crackers are then baked until golden and crispy.
