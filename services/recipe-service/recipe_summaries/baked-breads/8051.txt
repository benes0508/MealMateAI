This recipe is for **Cheddar, Bacon, and Fresh Chive Biscuits**, a savory baked good. It involves cooking bacon, combining dry ingredients (flour, leavening, salt) with chilled butter, then mixing in the cooked bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and fresh chives. Buttermilk is added to form a sticky dough, which is dropped onto a baking sheet and baked at 425Â°F for 18-20 minutes until golden. The biscuits are brushed with melted butter and can be served warm or at room temperature, optionally with honey.
