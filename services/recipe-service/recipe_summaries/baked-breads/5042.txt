This recipe details how to prepare a **Belgian Ale-Braised Brisket**. A 4-pound beef brisket is seasoned, then coated with a mustard-brown sugar-ginger rub and roasted until browned. It's then braised with caramelized onions, flour, bay leaf, Belgian tripel ale, and beef stock in a 300Â°F oven for 3-4 hours until fork-tender. After resting, the brisket is sliced and served with the reduced braising liquid. It can be made up to two days in advance.
