This recipe describes roasting whole chickens with red onions, lemon slices, and spring onions, basted in a garlic-butter mixture. The rendered chicken fat is then used to toast crusty bread. The dish is finished with a vibrant, spicy topping of raw spring onions, parsley, lemon, and crushed red pepper flakes, served alongside the carved chicken and roasted vegetables.
