This recipe details how to make Man'oushe, a Middle Eastern flatbread. It involves preparing a yeast-based dough, rolling it thin, and baking it on a hot pizza stone after brushing generously with a za'atar and olive oil mixture. The warm flatbread is then topped with a refreshing salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, grape tomatoes, and fresh mint, dressed with lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil.
