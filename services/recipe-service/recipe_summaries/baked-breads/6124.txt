This recipe yields homemade pretzel bites served with a quick cheddar dip. The pretzel dough involves activating yeast, kneading with flour, salt, sugar, and butter, followed by a long rise. Shaped dough pieces are briefly boiled in a baking soda solution, sprinkled with pretzel salt, and then baked at 450°F for 8-10 minutes until deep brown. The accompanying dip is made by puréeing cheddar cheese with dry white wine or water in a food processor until smooth and creamy.
