This recipe details how to make **French Macarons with Raspberry-Rose Buttercream**. It involves preparing delicate meringue-based almond (or almond-hazelnut) cookie shells, baked at two specific temperatures (375°F then 325°F). The filling consists of a homemade, partially strained raspberry jam and a luscious rose-infused Swiss meringue buttercream. The macarons are assembled with both the seeded jam and a piped spiral of the buttercream, requiring overnight chilling for optimal texture.
