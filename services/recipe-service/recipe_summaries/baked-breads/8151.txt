This recipe creates a sophisticated dessert featuring **Coconut-Piloncillo Ice Cream**, made with coconut milk, raw Mexican sugar (piloncillo), vanilla, and a hint of rum, churned to a soft consistency. It's served with homemade **Coconut Tortilla Chips**, crafted from flour tortillas coated in a sweetened coconut-sugar mixture and baked until crisp. The dish is completed with a refreshing **Fruit Salsa** of diced mangoes, strawberries, and fresh mint.
