This Muffuletta recipe features a chile-infused olive salad (with Calabrian chiles, various olives, capers, and piquillo peppers) spread on a ciabatta loaf. It's layered with thinly sliced Italian cured meats like salami, capocollo, mortadella, and prosciutto, along with provolone and mozzarella cheeses. The assembled sandwich is then tightly wrapped, pressed, and rested for 1-3 hours to allow the flavors to meld before serving. The olive salad can be prepared a day ahead.
