This recipe is for Baked Coconut (Cocada de Forno), a rich, moist dessert. It combines butter, sugar, eggs, coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and Malibu rum with grated coconut and a small amount of flour. The mixture is baked until golden with a slightly jiggly center and is traditionally served with lemon sorbet.
