This recipe details how to make a Roasted-Vegetable Lasagne featuring layers of oven-roasted eggplant, zucchini, and red bell peppers. It uses a rich, cheesy b√©chamel sauce made with Fontina and Parmigiano Reggiano, and fresh basil, all layered with pre-soaked no-boil lasagna noodles. The assembled lasagne is then baked until golden and bubbling, followed by a resting period before serving.
