This recipe creates delicate, crispy **Spiced Brown Butter and Walnut Tuille Cups**, which are edible cookie bowls. The process involves browning butter, then combining it with egg whites, sugar, Chinese five-spice powder, vanilla, and flour to form a thin batter. This batter is spread into thin rounds, topped with chopped walnuts, baked until golden, and then immediately molded over inverted custard cups to achieve their cup shape as they cool and set. They can be made ahead and stored airtight.
