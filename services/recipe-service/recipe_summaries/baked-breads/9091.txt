This recipe details a unique pizza featuring a homemade crust topped with Fontina and Parmigiano cheeses, thinly sliced par-boiled Yukon Gold potatoes, roasted red bell pepper, and dollops of black olive tapenade. It's brushed with garlic-infused olive oil before baking and finished with fresh rosemary and crushed red pepper.
