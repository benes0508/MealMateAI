This recipe details how to make a **Peach Lattice Pie with Bourbon Caramel**. It involves three main components: a rich, homemade bourbon caramel sauce; a flaky pie crust (one disc for the bottom, another for the lattice top); and a vibrant peach filling. The filling combines ripe peaches with brown and granulated sugars, tapioca for thickening, cinnamon, and lemon juice. The pie is assembled with the filling in the bottom crust, topped with a woven lattice, egg-washed, sprinkled with sugar, and baked until golden and bubbly. It's then cooled completely, ideally overnight, before being sliced and served with the accompanying bourbon caramel sauce.
