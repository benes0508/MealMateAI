A large, oven-baked Savory Dutch Baby pancake, made with a simple batter of eggs, milk, flour, and butter. It bakes in a hot skillet until dramatically puffed with crispy edges and a tender center, then deflates upon cooling. This versatile dish is designed for savory toppings like fried eggs, avocado, ham, smoked salmon, crispy bacon, or aged cheddar, making it ideal for a hearty breakfast, brunch, or light dinner.
