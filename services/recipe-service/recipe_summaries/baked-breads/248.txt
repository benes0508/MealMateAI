This recipe details how to make **Butter Pecan Skillet Cookies**, a large cookie baked in a cast-iron skillet, topped with a thin glaze and candied pecans. The process involves first **candying pecans** with maple syrup and salt, then incorporating some into a **butter pecan cookie dough** that's pressed into a buttered skillet and baked. After cooling, the cookie is cut into wedges, which are then **lightly dipped in a vanilla glaze** and decorated with the remaining candied pecans, sanding sugar, and edible glitter. The cookies can be made a day ahead and stored airtight at room temperature.
