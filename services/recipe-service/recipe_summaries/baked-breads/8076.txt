This Pear, Almond, and Dried-Cherry Brown Betty is a comforting baked dessert featuring layers of spiced fruit and a crisp, buttery crumb topping. It combines cubed pears and dried cherries (first soaked in brandy) with brown sugar, lemon, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. The topping is made from bread crumbs and sliced almonds, pre-baked for extra crispness, then tossed with melted butter. The dessert is assembled in layers, poured over with a honey-water mixture, and baked until golden and bubbly. It's best served warm with vanilla ice cream.
