This recipe is for "Trios" cookies, a type of drop cookie made with a simple butter dough. Each cookie consists of three small, flattened dough balls arranged in a triangle, with a deep indentation in each filled with a different fruit preserve (raspberry, apricot, and strawberry), before being baked until golden.
