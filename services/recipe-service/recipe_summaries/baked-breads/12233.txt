This recipe creates **Multigrain Toasts with Scrambled Eggs and Canadian Bacon**. Multigrain bread slices are buttered, centers cut out, and toasted in the oven until golden. Concurrently, chopped Canadian bacon is lightly browned in a skillet, followed by scrambled eggs cooked until just set. The scrambled eggs are then spooned into the holes of the toasted bread, and topped with sour cream and fresh chives.
