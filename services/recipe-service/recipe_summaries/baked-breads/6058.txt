This recipe details an **Apple Pie with a unique Cheddar Crust**. The crust is made from flour, salt, cheddar, butter, and shortening, chilled before rolling. The filling combines sliced Gala and Granny Smith apples with sugar, flour, lemon juice, and salt. The pie is assembled with the apple filling in the bottom crust, topped with the second crust, vented, and brushed with milk. It's baked in two stages: initially at 450°F, then at 375°F, until golden and bubbly, followed by a long cooling period.
