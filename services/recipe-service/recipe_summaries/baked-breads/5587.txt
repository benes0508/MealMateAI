French Crullers are light, classic pastries made from a cooked pâte à choux dough of water, butter, sugar, flour, and eggs. The versatile dough is piped into rings and can be either deep-fried until golden brown (370°F) or baked (initially at 450°F, then 350°F). After cooking and cooling, the crullers are coated with a basic sugar glaze. The same batter can also be used to prepare beignets.
