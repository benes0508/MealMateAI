"Pumpkin Stuffed with Everything Good" is a hearty, oven-baked dish featuring a whole pumpkin filled with a savory mixture. The pumpkin is hollowed out, seasoned, and then stuffed with a blend of stale bread, various cheeses (Gruyère, Emmenthal, cheddar), garlic, bacon, fresh herbs (chives, thyme), and heavy cream with nutmeg. Baked at 350°F for about two hours until tender and bubbling, it's served warm by mixing the cooked pumpkin flesh with the rich stuffing. It's suggested as a cold-weather main course or a Thanksgiving side, with variations like using rice, other vegetables, or different meats.
