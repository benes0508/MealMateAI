These Quince Apple Strudels feature a sweet and tart filling of quinces, simmered with star fruit syrup and vanilla, combined with roasted Gala apples and dried tart cherries. The fruit mixture is encased in a delicate, paper-thin homemade strudel dough, sprinkled with an almond-sugar-bread crumb mixture. Baked until golden, they are served warm, drizzled with the reserved reduced quince syrup, and accompanied by vanilla ice cream and star fruit chips.
