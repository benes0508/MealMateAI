This recipe is for a **Gluten-Free Coconut Bread** loaf. It features a blend of gluten-free flours (rice, sorghum, tapioca starch) and gets its rich flavor from shredded coconut (toasted), coconut milk, and optional coconut extract, topped with coconut flakes. The preparation involves toasting coconut, mixing wet and dry ingredients separately, combining them, and baking for 80-95 minutes. It can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 days.
