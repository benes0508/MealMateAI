This recipe features Arctic Char Gravlaks served with a refreshing Cucumber Jelly. The **gravlaks** is prepared by dry-curing an arctic char fillet for 36 hours with a mixture of sugar, salt, pepper, and fresh dill, then thinly slicing it. The **cucumber jelly** is made by pureeing cucumbers, extracting the liquid, dissolving gelatin into a portion, then combining with the rest and chilling until set. The dish is served by plating slices of gravlaks alongside pieces of the cucumber jelly, often with crispbread.
