This recipe is for "Crazy Sesame Breadsticks." It involves making a yeast dough, allowing it to rise, then rolling it out, brushing with water, and sprinkling generously with both white and black sesame seeds. The dough is then cut into thin strips, baked at 400Â°F for 10-15 minutes until crisp and golden brown. They can be stored for up to a week.
