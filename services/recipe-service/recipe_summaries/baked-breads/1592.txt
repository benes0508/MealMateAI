"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It Stuffing" is a savory baked stuffing recipe featuring dried sourdough bread, breakfast sausage, and sautéed aromatics (onion, fennel, celery) deglazed with white wine and fresh herbs (parsley, sage, thyme). The ingredients are combined with eggs and stock, then baked in stages, first covered at 350°F and then uncovered at 425°F, until golden brown and heated through. It can be assembled a day ahead.
