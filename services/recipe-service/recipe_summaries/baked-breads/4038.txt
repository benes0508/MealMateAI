A baked appetizer or snack featuring precooked pork sausages (such as andouille or kielbasa) wrapped in puff pastry. The pastry is brushed with a baking soda egg wash and sprinkled with salt and poppy seeds before baking, giving it a pretzel-like sheen and flavor. Typically sliced into bite-size portions and served with Dijon mustard.
