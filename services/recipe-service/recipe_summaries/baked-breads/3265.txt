This recipe details how to prepare Cornbread-Stuffed Roasted Squash. Acorn squash halves are roasted until tender, then filled with a savory stuffing made from toasted cornbread cubes, rehydrated dried cranberries and currants, sautÃ©ed vegetables (onion, celery, carrot, sage, garlic), pecans, and fresh parsley. The stuffed squash is then baked again until golden and tender.
