A deep-dish peach pie featuring a buttery oat and pecan streusel topping. It includes a flaky homemade pie crust, a sweet peach filling thickened with tapioca and spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. Both the crust and streusel can be prepared ahead of time. The pie is baked until golden and bubbling, then cooled before serving warm or at room temperature.
