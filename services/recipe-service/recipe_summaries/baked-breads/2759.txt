This recipe details how to make a **Raspberry Crumble Tart**. It involves preparing a flaky pastry crust from flour, butter, shortening, and salt, then chilling it. A separate crumble topping is made from a reserved portion of the dough mixture, almonds, and sugar. Fresh raspberries fill the tart shell, which is then topped with the crumble and baked at 375Â°F for 55-60 minutes until golden and bubbling. The tart is cooled completely before serving.
