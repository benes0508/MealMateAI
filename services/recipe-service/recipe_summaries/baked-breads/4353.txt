A modern take on the BLT, this recipe features crispy baked bacon, fresh tomatoes, and mixed greens, all elevated by a homemade pimiento cheese spread. The spread combines sharp cheddar, mayonnaise, roasted red peppers, and a spicy kick from pickled jalape√±os. Both the pimiento cheese and assembled sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time.
