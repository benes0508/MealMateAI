This recipe details a savory Masa Cornbread Stuffing with Chiles. Masa cornbread cubes are combined with a sautéed mixture of onions, garlic, and a generous variety of fresh (Anaheim, Poblano, Jalapeño) and ground New Mexico chiles, seasoned with oregano and cumin. The mixture is bound with eggs and chicken broth (with optional Monterey Jack cheese) and then baked until golden and heated through.
