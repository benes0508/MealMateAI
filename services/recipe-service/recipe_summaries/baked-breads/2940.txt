This recipe details a Croque Madame Casserole, a baked dish layering day-old white bread, Black Forest ham, and Gruyère cheese, all enveloped in a rich Mornay sauce (Béchamel with Gruyère and a touch of nutmeg and Dijon). Six eggs are cracked into holes cut into the top layer of bread, then baked until the whites are set and yolks are runny.
