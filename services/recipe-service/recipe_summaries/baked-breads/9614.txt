This recipe details how to prepare Semolina Gnocchi with Oxtail Ragù. The rich ragù is made by browning and slow-braising oxtails with aromatic vegetables, red wine, crushed tomatoes, and herbs until incredibly tender. The semolina gnocchi are prepared by cooking semolina with milk, butter, egg yolks, and Parmesan, then chilling, cutting into rounds, and baking. The dish is assembled by layering the semolina gnocchi with the warm oxtail ragù, topped with more Parmesan, and baked until heated through. Both components can be made ahead of time.
