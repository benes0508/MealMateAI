This recipe transforms classic baked macaroni and cheese into crispy, waffle-iron cooked portions. First, a standard baked mac and cheese is prepared with elbow pasta, a cheddar cheese sauce (roux-based with milk and a touch of mustard), and then baked until golden. The key step is to thoroughly chill the baked mac and cheese loaf, then slice it. These slices are then breaded (flour, egg, seasoned breadcrumbs with parmesan) and cooked in a waffle iron until heated through and golden-brown, creating a unique texture and presentation.
