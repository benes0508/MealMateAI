This recipe details how to make homemade dumpling dough, suitable for both boiling and pan-frying. Ingredients include all-purpose flour, lukewarm water, salt, and an egg white. The preparation involves mixing and kneading the dough twice, with a resting period in between, until it becomes smooth and pliable. The dough is then portioned into 24 balls, each rolled into a 3-4 inch diameter wrapper with thin, translucent edges, ready to be filled. Keep finished wrappers covered to prevent drying.
