Raspberry Rugelach are classic cream cheese pastry cookies, featuring a tender, flaky dough. They are filled with a delightful mix of raspberry jam, chopped walnuts, and orange zest, then rolled, cut into distinctive wedges, and topped with a vibrant raspberry-sugar sprinkle before baking. This recipe involves multiple chilling steps and is excellent for making ahead, storing well for up to 5 days.
