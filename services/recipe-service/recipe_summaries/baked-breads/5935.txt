This recipe details how to make homemade Butter Crackers using a blend of spelt, whole wheat, and oat flours, butter, and baking powder. The dough is prepared in a food processor, rolled thin, pricked with a fork, and cut into shapes. The crackers are then brushed with an egg wash, baked for 5-10 minutes until lightly browned, and finally brushed with a melted butter and salt mixture while still warm.
