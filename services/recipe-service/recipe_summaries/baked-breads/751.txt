This recipe details how to make a **Deep Dish Quiche** featuring a crispy, blind-baked pie dough crust in a springform pan. The quiche is filled with a savory sautéed **shallot and chive mixture** and a rich **custard made from eggs, half-and-half, and crème fraîche**. It's baked until puffed and golden, then cooled before serving. A highlight of this recipe is the extensive list of **optional garnishes** for guests to customize their slices, including braised vegetables, cured meats (prosciutto, salmon), crème fraîche, green goddess dressing, avocado, and fresh greens with lemon. Both the crust and the finished quiche can be prepared ahead of time.
