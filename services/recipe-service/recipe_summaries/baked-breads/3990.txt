Anadama Bread is a rustic, hearty baked loaf characterized by its distinctive use of molasses and cornmeal, enriched with a variety of seeds (including hemp, nigella, and flax). It undergoes multiple rises for a tender texture and a deep golden-brown crust, ideal for serving with butter, and can be prepared up to 5 days in advance.
