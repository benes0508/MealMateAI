This recipe is for a **Swiss Chard and Mushroom Galette**, a rustic, savory tart. It features a flaky, buttery crust made with all-purpose and whole wheat flours, filled with seasoned ricotta cheese, saut√©ed maitake/crimini mushrooms, and wilted Swiss chard. The galette is baked until golden and finished with fresh herbs, lemon zest, and flaky sea salt for a bright, aromatic touch.
