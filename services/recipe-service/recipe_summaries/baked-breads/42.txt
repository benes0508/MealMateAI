This recipe details how to make a **Pumpkin Dutch Baby** served with a homemade **Pumpkin Butter**. The Dutch baby involves blending eggs, pumpkin purée, milk, butter, flour, and spices (cinnamon, allspice, ginger, nutmeg) into a batter, then baking it in a hot, buttered ovenproof skillet until golden and puffed. Concurrently, the pumpkin butter is made by simmering the remaining pumpkin purée with apple cider, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt until thickened. The Dutch baby is served sliced, topped with the warm pumpkin butter and a dusting of powdered sugar.
