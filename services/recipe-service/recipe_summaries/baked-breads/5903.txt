This recipe is for **Rugelach**, a traditional Jewish pastry resembling small crescent-shaped cookies. The dough is made from cream cheese, butter, and flour, then chilled. Fillings include a mix of liquefied jam (raspberry/apricot), cinnamon sugar, chopped nuts (pecans, walnuts, or almonds), dried currants, and chocolate. The chilled dough is rolled into circles, spread with the filling, cut into wedges, and rolled into crescents. After a final chill, they are brushed with an egg wash, sprinkled with coarse sugar, and baked until golden.
