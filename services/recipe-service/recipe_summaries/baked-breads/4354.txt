This recipe details how to make Prosciutto, Watercress, and Fontina Toasties, an elevated grilled cheese sandwich. Prosciutto is first baked until crisp, then layered with Fontina cheese and fresh watercress between buttered Pullman bread slices. The sandwiches are pan-fried until golden brown and the cheese is melted, then trimmed and cut into triangles.
