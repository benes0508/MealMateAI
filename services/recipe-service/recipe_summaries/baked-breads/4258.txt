"Greco" is a Mediterranean-inspired pizza featuring a homemade dough base. It's topped with thinly sliced, pre-cooked zucchini and yellow squash, mozzarella, crumbled feta, Kalamata olives, and Peppadew peppers. The pizza is baked on stones for a crisp crust, then finished with Pecorino Romano, dried oregano, a drizzle of garlic oil, and a squeeze of grilled lemon.
