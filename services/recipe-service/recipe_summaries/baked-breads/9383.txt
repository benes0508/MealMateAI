This recipe details an **Almond and Marmalade Torte** topped with a decorative lattice crust. It features a rich, two-part butter and almond-flour enriched pastry for both the base and lattice strips. The torte is filled with a layer of vibrant orange marmalade, topped by a sweet almond filling subtly spiced with ground cloves. After baking until golden, it's finished with a glossy orange marmalade glaze and traditionally served with Grand Marnier whipped cream.
