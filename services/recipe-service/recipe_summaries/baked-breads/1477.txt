This recipe is for a savory Roasted Garlic Pull-Apart Cheese Bread. It involves roasting garlic until soft, then combining it with a blend of mozzarella, fontina, Parmesan, and Pecorino Romano cheeses, chives, and red pepper flakes. An artisan or sourdough loaf is scored into a grid pattern without cutting through, then stuffed generously with the cheese mixture. Drizzled with melted butter, the loaf is baked until the cheese is gooey and bubbly, creating an easily shareable, flavorful appetizer.
