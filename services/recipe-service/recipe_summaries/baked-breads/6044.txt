Hamantaschen are traditional triangular pastries or cookies, typically prepared with a lemon-zest dough. They can be filled with one of two homemade options: a smooth apricot or prune filling, or a spiced poppy seed mixture with raisins. The dough is chilled, then rolled into disks, filled, folded into the distinctive triangular shape, and finally baked until golden brown.
