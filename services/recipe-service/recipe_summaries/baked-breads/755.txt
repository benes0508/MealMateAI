"Bacon and Cheddar Toasts" are savory appetizers featuring a mixture of sharp white cheddar, finely chopped bacon, onion, and horseradish spread on thin white bread. The toasts are briefly frozen, crusts trimmed, cut into squares, and then baked at 375Â°F for about 20 minutes until golden and crisp.
