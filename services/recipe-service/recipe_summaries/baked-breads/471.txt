This recipe describes a savory Cornbread Stuffing featuring a hearty base of dried cornbread combined with cooked breakfast sausage. It incorporates a unique twist with finely ground corn nuts for added texture and flavor, along with saut√©ed aromatics (onions, celery, garlic, chiles), fresh herbs (sage, thyme), white wine, and is bound with eggs and stock before being baked until golden brown. It's a make-ahead friendly dish.
