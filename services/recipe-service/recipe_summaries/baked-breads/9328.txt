This recipe is for Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti, a twice-baked Italian cookie. It features a dough made with flour, sugar, eggs, and butter, flavored with dried cranberries, slivered almonds, shelled pistachios, lemon zest, and anise seeds. The dough is formed into a log, baked, sliced, and then baked again until toasted for a crisp texture.
