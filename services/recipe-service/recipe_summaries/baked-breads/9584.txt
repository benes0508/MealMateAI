This recipe prepares Garnet Yams (or sweet potatoes) baked with a maple syrup, butter, and apple cider vinegar glaze. The yams are first baked covered, then topped with a sweet, crispy streusel made from maple sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, butter, and grated yam, and baked uncovered until tender and golden.
