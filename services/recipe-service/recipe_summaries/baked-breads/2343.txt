This recipe details how to make **Potato Blinis**, savory pancakes made from baked Yukon Gold potatoes. The potatoes are riced and combined with egg yolks, sour cream, flour, and seasonings to form a thick batter. Small portions of the batter are then cooked in a skillet with butter until golden brown, similar to traditional blinis or small pancakes. The blinis can be kept warm until serving.
