This recipe creates "Coconut Macaroon Sandwiches with Lime Curd". It involves baking coconut macaroons from a mixture of shredded coconut, sugar, flour, salt, egg whites, and almond extract. Simultaneously, a tangy lime curd is prepared by cooking lime juice, zest, sugar, cornstarch, salt, butter, and egg yolks until thickened, then chilling it. Once both components are cooled, the lime curd is piped between two macaroons to form a sandwich.
