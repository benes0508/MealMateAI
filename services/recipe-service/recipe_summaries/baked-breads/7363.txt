This recipe details **Faux-Fried Onion Rings** made by soaking Vidalia onion rings in milk, coating them in whole wheat flour, egg whites, and whole wheat panko, then baking them at 425Â°F until golden and crispy (approx. 20 min). They are served with a homemade **Smoky Mayonnaise** dip, a blend of mayonnaise, liquid smoke, and Tabasco. This offers a healthier, baked alternative to traditional fried onion rings.
