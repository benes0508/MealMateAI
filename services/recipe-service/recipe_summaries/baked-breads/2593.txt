This recipe is for **Challah Bread**, a traditional braided bread. It involves mixing and kneading a dough made from water, yeast, flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and oil. The dough undergoes two rising periods, first after initial kneading, and then after being divided, rolled into ropes, and braided (typically into 3 loaves using 3 ropes each). Before baking, the challahs are brushed with an egg wash and topped with seeds (nigella, poppy, or sesame). They are baked at 425Â°F until golden brown.
