This recipe details a **Chicken Thigh Potpie** featuring roasted rutabaga, sweet potato, pearl onions, saut√©ed oyster mushrooms, and kale. Boneless, skin-on chicken thighs are pan-fried and then combined with a savory gravy made with chicken stock, herbs (thyme, rosemary), and garlic. A unique, homemade **cornmeal and flour crust** is prepared separately, partially pre-baked, and then placed on top of the bubbly chicken and vegetable filling before a final bake.
