This recipe details a multi-layered dessert featuring a sweet-tart pink grapefruit marmalade spread over crisp, baked shortbread-like pastry rectangles. It's topped with dehydrated pink grapefruit segments and served alongside unconventional Edamame Ice Cream, garnished with black sesame seeds and celery leaves. The dish combines citrusy brightness with unique savory and aromatic notes (star anise).
