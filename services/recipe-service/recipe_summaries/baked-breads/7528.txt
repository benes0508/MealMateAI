This recipe details how to make Bitter Orange Crème Brûlée, a sophisticated dessert featuring a rich, orange-zest infused custard topped with a brittle caramelized sugar crust. The recipe also includes instructions for optional "sugar cookies" made from egg whites, flour, and sugar, which can be served alongside the brûlée. The preparation involves making and chilling the custard, followed by torching or broiling the sugar just before serving, with fresh mint as a garnish.
