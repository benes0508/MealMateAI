This recipe details a traditional Lasagna Bolognese, featuring a rich, slow-cooked meat sauce (ground beef, pork, pancetta, vegetables, wine, milk, tomatoes, simmered for 2.5-3 hours, ideally chilled overnight for deeper flavor). It includes instructions for making fresh egg pasta noodles from scratch and a classic béchamel sauce. The lasagna is assembled in multiple layers of homemade noodles, Bolognese, béchamel, and Parmesan, then baked until bubbly and browned. This is a multi-step recipe requiring significant preparation time for optimal flavor.
