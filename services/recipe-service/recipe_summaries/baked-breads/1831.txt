This recipe creates Oatmeal Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches, featuring cookies uniquely made with brown butter and crushed waffle cones for a toasty flavor and texture. Any flavor of softened ice cream is sandwiched between the cookies, then frozen until firm, with an extended freeze recommended for optimally soft cookies.
