This recipe provides instructions for making golden yellow cornbread or corn muffins. It involves combining cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder with oil, milk, and egg to form a batter. The batter is then baked at 425Â°F in a greased 9x9-inch pan for 20-25 minutes for cornbread, or in muffin tins for 15-20 minutes for muffins. A variation for a sweeter, moister result is also included.
