Pumpkin Cheesecake Crumble Squares are a multi-layered dessert featuring a creamy, spiced pumpkin cheesecake filling baked atop a pecan and oat crumble crust. The squares are finished with a smooth sour cream topping and additional crumble, requiring chilling for best results. They can be prepared up to two days in advance.
