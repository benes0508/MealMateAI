This multi-layered dessert features crisp peppermint meringue layers, moist chocolate sponge cake layers, a peppermint schnapps syrup, and rich chocolate buttercream. The meringues are baked low and slow until dry and crisp. The chocolate cake is prepared as a thin sheet, then cut into layers. A simple syrup infused with peppermint schnapps moistens the cake layers. The buttercream is a mixture of cream, butter, and chocolate. The cake is assembled by alternating these components, then frosted, garnished with chocolate mint wafers, raspberries, and mint leaves, and chilled before serving.
