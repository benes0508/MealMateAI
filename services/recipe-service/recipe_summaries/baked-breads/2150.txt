This Bacon and Egg Casserole features a savory filling of whisked eggs, Gruyère cheese, heavy cream, potatoes, spinach, sautéed onions, and crispy bacon. Halved hard-boiled eggs are arranged on top, and the casserole is covered with a decorative lattice of puff pastry strips before being baked until golden brown.
