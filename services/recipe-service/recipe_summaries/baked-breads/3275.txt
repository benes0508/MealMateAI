**Individual Orange Cranberry Biscuits** are a delightful baked treat, combining whole wheat and all-purpose flours with the bright flavors of orange zest and juice, and tart cranberries. Enriched with Greek yogurt, the dough is formed into wedges, brushed with milk, and baked at 400°F (200°C) for 30-35 minutes until lightly browned.
