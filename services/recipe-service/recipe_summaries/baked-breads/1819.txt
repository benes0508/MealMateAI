This recipe for Honey Brioche details how to make a rich, soft bread using milk, yeast, fragrant honey, eggs, flour, salt, and butter. The process involves creating an initial sponge, incorporating remaining ingredients and softened butter into the dough, followed by two extended rises (including an overnight refrigeration). The dough is then divided, shaped into balls for loaves, given a final proof, and baked until puffed and golden. The honey enhances flavor and moisture, and the brioche is best enjoyed fresh.
