This recipe features **Herb-Crusted Cauliflower Steaks** as a vegetarian main, served with roasted green beans, white beans, and cherry tomatoes. The cauliflower "steaks" are roasted until tender, then topped with a savory panko-Parmesan-herb crust and finished with a creamy mayonnaise-dijon spread. The beans and tomatoes are tossed with a lemon-herb oil, roasted, and combined to complete this flavorful and hearty meal.
