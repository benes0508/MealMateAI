This recipe is for an **Old-Fashioned Mixed-Apple Pie** featuring a double-crust made from flour, butter, and shortening. The filling consists of assorted apples (like Pink Lady, Pippin, Golden Delicious) mixed with sugar, raisins, quick-cooking tapioca for thickening, lemon peel, salt, and nutmeg. Graham cracker crumbs are sprinkled on the bottom crust, and the pie is baked at 425°F for 15 minutes, then at 375°F for about an hour until golden and bubbling.
