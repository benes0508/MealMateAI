This recipe details how to make **Golden Dinner Rolls** using a **sweet potato "sponge"** method. It involves baking and mashing sweet potato, then creating a pre-ferment (sponge) with flour, water, honey, and yeast. The remaining ingredients, including sweet potato and butter, are added and kneaded in a stand mixer until smooth. The dough undergoes two rises, is divided into small balls, dipped in melted butter, and given a final rise before baking. The rolls are baked at a high temperature with steam (using ice cubes in a pan) to achieve a golden-brown crust. Chef's notes emphasize temperature control for rising, a potential two-day preparation, and the importance of oven preheating and steam for texture.
