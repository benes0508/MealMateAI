This recipe for Green Bean Casserole presents two distinct preparation methods. One variation combines green beans with a creamy **tomato soup** base, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce, baked and then finished with a broiled topping of bread crumbs, paprika, butter, and cheese. The second, more traditional variation uses a creamy **mushroom soup** and milk base mixed with French-fried onion rings, baked, and topped with additional crispy onions.
