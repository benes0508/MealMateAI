This recipe is for "Lime Snowballs," which are light, buttery cookies flavored with lime juice, zest, and oil, then dusted with powdered sugar. The dough is made with flour, cornstarch, butter, and powdered sugar, chilled, formed into small balls, baked until golden, and then generously coated with more powdered sugar. They are a sweet, citrus-flavored dessert similar to a shortbread cookie, designed to be stored airtight.
