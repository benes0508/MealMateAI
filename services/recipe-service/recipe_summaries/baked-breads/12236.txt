This recipe details how to make individual Apple Tarts with Vanilla Ice Cream. Gala apples are thinly sliced and arranged on thawed puff pastry squares, then brushed with a vanilla-sugar syrup (made with apple skins for flavor) and melted butter, and sprinkled with sugar. The tarts are baked until golden, then brushed with reduced syrup. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
