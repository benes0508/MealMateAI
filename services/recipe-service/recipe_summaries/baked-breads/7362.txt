This recipe is for traditional Hot Cross Buns, sweet spiced buns made with a combination of white bread and all-purpose flour, enriched with egg and butter. Key flavorings include raisins or currants, orange zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. The process involves two dough rises, shaping the buns, piping a flour-and-water cross on top before baking, and finishing with a warm apricot jam glaze.
