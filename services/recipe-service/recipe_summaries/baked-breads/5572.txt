This recipe details how to make "Woodman Cheese and Crackers," featuring homemade ricotta cheese and savory rye-whole wheat crackers. The ricotta is prepared by heating milk and cream with salt, then curdling with lemon juice and straining until thick. The crackers are made from a dough of whole wheat and rye flours, caraway seeds, butter, and yogurt, rolled thin, cut, chilled, and baked until crisp. To serve, spread the homemade ricotta on the crackers, garnished with edible flowers and sea salt.
