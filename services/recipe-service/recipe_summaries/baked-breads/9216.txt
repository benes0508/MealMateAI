This recipe for "Nonna's Biscotti" features a classic Italian cookie made with sugar, butter, brandy, almond and vanilla extracts, whole almonds, eggs, flour, baking powder, and salt. The dough is mixed, chilled, then formed into two loaves and baked twice: first until pale golden, then sliced and baked again until golden and crisp.
