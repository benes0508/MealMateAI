This recipe details the preparation of an Asparagus Custard Tart. It involves making a flaky butter pastry crust, blanching asparagus and sautÃ©ing leeks, then combining them with a savory custard made from heavy cream, eggs, and fresh tarragon. The tart is baked until golden and set, with asparagus tips added partway through baking, and is served warm or at room temperature.
