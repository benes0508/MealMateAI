This recipe is for "Chewy Ginger-Rye Cookies," featuring a blend of all-purpose and rye flours, robust dark molasses, and both ground and finely chopped crystallized ginger for intense flavor and chew. Key spices include cinnamon and cloves. A unique streusel topping made with raw sugar, rye flour, ginger, and butter is added before baking, contributing to a slightly cracked, chewy cookie with spiced warmth. The dough can be made ahead and frozen.
