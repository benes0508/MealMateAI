This recipe details how to make classic garlic bread by halving a loaf of Italian bread and spreading it with a fragrant mixture of butter, finely chopped garlic (mashed with salt), olive oil, and parsley. It's then generously topped with Parmesan cheese. The bread is baked covered at 350Â°F until heated through, then broiled uncovered for a few minutes until golden and crispy.
