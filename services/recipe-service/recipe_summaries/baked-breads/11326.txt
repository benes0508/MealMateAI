This recipe details how to prepare savory Yorkshire Pudding, enhanced with bacon and sage. It involves first crisping bacon and reserving its drippings, which are heated in a baking dish. A smooth batter is then made from flour, milk, eggs, and fresh sage, with some of the cooked bacon mixed in. This batter is poured into the hot drippings and baked at high heat (450°F) then reduced (350°F) until puffed and golden. The dish is finished with a crumble of the remaining bacon and a sprinkle of fresh sage before serving.
