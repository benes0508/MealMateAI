Southern Mac and Cheese combines very tender elbow macaroni with a rich, creamy sauce made from a butter-flour roux, whole milk, American, and Parmesan cheeses, seasoned with pepper and mustard powder. The dish is topped with more American cheese and paprika, then baked at 350Â°F for 40-45 minutes until golden and bubbling.
