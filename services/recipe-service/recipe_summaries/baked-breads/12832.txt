This recipe details a **Coconut-Chocolate Marjolaine**, a sophisticated French layer cake. It features delicate **coconut meringue (dacquoise) layers** interspersed with a rich, spreadable **chocolate rum ganache**. The entire cake is then enrobed in a glossy **chocolate rum glaze** and garnished with **toasted coconut** chips. The process involves preparing the ganache and chilling it, baking the coconut meringues, assembling the cake by layering meringue and ganache, and finally glazing and chilling before serving.
