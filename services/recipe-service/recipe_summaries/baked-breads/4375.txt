This recipe creates a sophisticated Halvah Mille-Feuilles, a layered dessert featuring crispy, baked phyllo dough stacks. The phyllo is brushed with oil and sugar before baking until golden. A creamy filling is made by combining tahini, honey or date syrup, and whipped topping or heavy cream. The dessert is assembled by layering the baked phyllo stacks with the tahini-honey cream, then finished with a drizzle of syrup, crumbled halvah, and fresh raspberries.
