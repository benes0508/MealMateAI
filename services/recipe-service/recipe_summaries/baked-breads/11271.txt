This recipe is for **Scottish Sharp-Cheddar Shortbread**, a savory twist on traditional shortbread. It combines butter with salt, black pepper, cayenne, and shredded extra-sharp white cheddar cheese, along with all-purpose flour. The dough is mixed, chilled, rolled out, cut into rounds, and then baked at 350Â°F for 13-15 minutes until lightly golden.
