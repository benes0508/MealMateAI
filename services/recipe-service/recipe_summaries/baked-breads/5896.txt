This recipe details how to make "The Nora Ephron" Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies. It involves creating a creamy peanut butter filling (with creamy peanut butter, butter, powdered sugar, honey, and salt) that is chilled. The cookies themselves are made from a dough containing crunchy peanut butter, butter, granulated and brown sugars, eggs, vanilla, flour, oats, baking soda, and baking powder. After preparing the dough, 1-ounce scoops are chilled for at least 2 hours, then baked at 375Â°F for about 12 minutes. Once the cookies are completely cooled, they are assembled into sandwiches by spreading the chilled filling between two cookies.
