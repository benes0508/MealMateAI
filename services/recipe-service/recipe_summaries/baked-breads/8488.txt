This recipe prepares firm white fish fillets in a rich pine nut sauce. The sauce features toasted and ground pine nuts, saut√©ed onion, paprika, garlic, breadcrumbs, tomatoes, and fish stock (or white wine), with optional saffron. The fish is typically browned then simmered in the sauce until opaque, or it can be poached directly in the sauce or baked with it. Garnish with whole pine nuts and fresh parsley.
