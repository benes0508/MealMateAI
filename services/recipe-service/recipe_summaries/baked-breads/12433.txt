Triple-Chocolate Cookies are a rich, decadent treat featuring three forms of chocolate: melted bittersweet, unsweetened cocoa powder, and semisweet chocolate chips. The dough combines traditional baking ingredients with the melted chocolate, resulting in a soft, chewy cookie that's baked until the tops are cracked. This recipe is ideal for making ahead, as the cookies can be frozen for later enjoyment.
