This recipe details how to make a **Top-Crust Peach and Cardamom Pie**. It involves preparing a butter pastry dough, cutting it into decorative shapes (like hearts or scallops) for the top crust. The filling is made with sliced peaches, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and ground cardamom. The peach filling is placed in a pie dish, covered with the dough cutouts, brushed with egg wash, and sprinkled with raw sugar before being baked until golden and bubbly. The pie is served warm or at room temperature, optionally with honey yogurt.
