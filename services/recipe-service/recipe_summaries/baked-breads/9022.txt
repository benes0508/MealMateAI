This recipe creates a savory Flatbread with Shrimp and White Bean Hummus. It involves preparing homemade flatbreads, a flavorful white bean hummus (made with roasted garlic, tahini, and lemon), caramelized onions, and saut√©ed leeks. The pre-baked flatbreads are then topped with the hummus, onions, leeks, shrimp, lemon slices, and grated cheese, before being baked again until warmed through. Finished with fresh microgreens, it's a gourmet, multi-component dish.
