A sophisticated dessert featuring a unique take on apple crumble. This recipe creates a homemade crème fraîche ice cream with stewed apples (infused with Calvados and a hint of pink peppercorn) and baked crumble pieces folded directly into it during churning. The result is a rich, tangy, and textural frozen treat that combines all the classic flavors.
