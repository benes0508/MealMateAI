This recipe details how to make "Snickerdoodle Party Cookies" with a unique twist. These cookies feature brown butter, a spiced sugar coating with cardamom and cinnamon, and are studded with Skor bars and coated in crushed cornflakes for added texture. The dough is made by creaming brown butter with sugars, then incorporating eggs, vanilla, and dry ingredients before folding in chopped Skor bars. After a short rest, the dough is scooped, coated in cornflakes, then in spiced sugar, and baked until the edges are set. Optional gold or rainbow dust can be added for serving.
