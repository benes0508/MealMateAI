This recipe features **Cheddar Crisps** made from sharp cheddar, flour, cayenne, and butter, baked in mini muffin tins until golden. These are topped with a **Roasted Grape Relish** prepared by roasting red grapes with oil, salt, and pepper, then combining them with finely chopped green olives, celery, red onion, jalape√±o, minced garlic, orange zest, red wine vinegar, and toasted pine nuts. The relish is spooned onto the cooled crisps just before serving.
