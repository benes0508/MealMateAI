This recipe is for homemade **Dog Biscuits**, a pet-friendly treat. It combines various flours (all-purpose, whole wheat), cornmeal, oats, wheat germ, and butter, flavored with fresh parsley and mint. The dough is processed, rolled out, cut into biscuit shapes, brushed with an egg wash, baked until golden, and then dried overnight in the turned-off oven for crispness.
