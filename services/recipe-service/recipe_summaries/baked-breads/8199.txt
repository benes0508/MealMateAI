This recipe details how to prepare a Broiled Chicken, Romaine, and Tomato Bruschetta. It involves broiling an Italian bread slice, a chicken cutlet coated in a creamy lemon-Dijon-Parmesan sauce, seasoned plum tomato halves, and oil-dressed romaine lettuce. The garlic-rubbed toast is then topped with the broiled chicken, tomato, and wilted romaine, served with the reserved sauce.
