This recipe for **Sweet Potato Purée with Streusel Topping** features baked orange-fleshed sweet potatoes mashed with butter and brown sugar, then topped with a crumbly streusel made from flour, brown sugar, and butter.

The potatoes are first baked until tender (about 50 minutes), then mashed and spread into a baking dish. The streusel is sprinkled on top, and the dish is baked again until golden brown (about 40 minutes). The dish can be prepared in advance, with the purée and streusel stored separately for up to 2 days, or the completed dish refrigerated for 1 day. A variation is also provided, substituting marshmallows for the streusel topping.
