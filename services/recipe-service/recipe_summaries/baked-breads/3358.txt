This recipe is for **Rosemary Garlic Potato Bread**, made with russet potatoes, roasted garlic, and fresh rosemary. The dough, prepared in a stand mixer, undergoes two rises before being shaped into loaves. It's then brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with salt and rosemary, slashed, and baked at 400Â°F until golden and hollow when tapped. Note: Do not refrigerate the finished bread.
