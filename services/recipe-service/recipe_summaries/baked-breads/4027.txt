This recipe is for a **savory tart** featuring a rich **custard filling** of eggs, crème fraîche, and heavy cream. The main flavors come from **caramelized garlic** (cooked until tender and syrupy with balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, rosemary, and thyme), **fresh spinach**, and **sharp white cheddar cheese**. The tart has an **all-butter pie crust** that is blind-baked and adorned with decorative braided strips before being filled and baked until the custard is set and golden.
