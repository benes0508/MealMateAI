This recipe details how to make thin, crispy Moravian Crisps with Royal Icing. The process involves blending shortening, brown sugar, and molasses, then adding dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt) to form a dough. After chilling the dough for at least a day, it's rolled very thin, cut into shapes, and baked until crisp. A separate royal icing is made from confectioners sugar, egg whites, water, lemon juice, and vanilla, then piped onto the cooled cookies for decoration.
