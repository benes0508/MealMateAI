This recipe for Turkey Enchiladas features a rich sauce made from roasted San Marzano tomatoes, ancho and arbol chiles, vegetables, and spices, uniquely cooked in the roasting pan with a turkey to absorb its drippings. Pulled turkey is then mixed with some of this flavorful sauce and two types of Mexican cheese (queso fresco and chihuahua) to create the filling for flour tortillas. The rolled enchiladas are covered with more sauce and cheese, then baked until hot and bubbly, served with sour cream and lime.
