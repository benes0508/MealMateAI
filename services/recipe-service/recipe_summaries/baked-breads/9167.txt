This is a comprehensive recipe for **Basic Brioche**, a rich, soft, buttery, and slightly sweet enriched bread. The detailed instructions guide users through a multi-day process involving a sponge starter, a high ratio of butter and eggs, and extended chilling (up to 2 days) to manage the initially sticky dough and develop flavor. The recipe outlines multiple rises, including a "business letter turn" for texture, and shaping into traditional individual brioche with topknots, baked with an egg glaze.

Crucially, it includes versatile variations to make:
*   A **Brioche Loaf**
*   **Black Pepper Brioche** (for savory applications)
*   **Sweet Potato Brioche** (adding moisture and color)
*   A **Challah** (braided loaf) using a double brioche dough.

The recipe also provides bread machine instructions and helpful tips for dough handling and baking.
