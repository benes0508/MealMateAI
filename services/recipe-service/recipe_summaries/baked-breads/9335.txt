Orange Pistachio Crescents are buttery crescent-shaped cookies filled with a sweet-tart candied orange peel and pistachio mixture. The recipe involves making a rich shortcrust-style dough, preparing a filling by simmering finely chopped orange peel in sugar syrup and mixing it with pistachios, then assembling by filling dough rounds, shaping them into crescents, baking until golden, and coating in confectioners' sugar.
