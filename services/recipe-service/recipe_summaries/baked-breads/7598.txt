Milk Bar Pie is a unique dessert pie featuring a distinctive butter-and-brown-sugar-infused oatmeal cookie crust. It's filled with a rich, buttery, and custardy filling enhanced with nonfat dry milk powder for its signature sweet, caramelized, and "cereal milk" flavor. The pie is baked until browned in spots, then chilled overnight for optimal setting and flavor, and typically served cold with a dusting of powdered sugar.
