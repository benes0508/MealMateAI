**Ginger and Almond Bars** are a baked dessert featuring a two-layer construction. The base is a soft, chewy blend of almond meal, fresh ginger, and honey. It's topped with a sweet, "sizzling" layer of sliced almonds, candied ginger, and more honey. This recipe yields 16 squares, perfect for a sweet treat or snack, and can be stored at room temperature for up to a week. A variation, "Chestnut Honey Squares," offers an alternative using all-purpose flour, chestnut honey, and candied orange or lemon peel.
