This recipe is for "Salted Rye Cookies," which are crisp, buttery cookies made with rye flour and flavored with orange zest, a pinch of salt, and a coarse sparkling sugar coating. The dough is prepared by creaming butter and sugar, mixing in egg, salt, orange zest, and rye flour. It's then shaped into logs, chilled until firm, rolled in a salt and coarse sugar mixture, sliced into thin rounds, and baked at 350°F (175°C) for about 16 minutes until lightly browned. They can be stored for up to a week at room temperature.
