This recipe details how to make a **Breakfast Pizza** using a homemade or store-bought dough. It features a base of two types of mozzarella, topped with baby spinach, garlic, fresh sausage, and heavy cream. After an initial bake, eggs are cracked onto the pizza and it's returned to the oven to finish cooking until the crust is deeply browned and blistered, optionally broiled. The pizza is then garnished with fresh chives, crushed red pepper flakes, olive oil, and grated hard cheese.
