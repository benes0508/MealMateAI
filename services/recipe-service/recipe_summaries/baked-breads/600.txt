This recipe details how to make a **Tomato Galette**, a rustic, free-form tart featuring a flaky pastry crust. It involves preparing a homemade dough (using flour, butter, apple cider vinegar, and ice water), then filling it with sliced heirloom tomatoes, thinly sliced garlic, and a firm grated cheese (like Asiago, cheddar, or gouda). The edges of the dough are folded over the filling, brushed with egg wash, and then baked until golden brown. The finished galette is garnished with lemon zest and fresh chives.
