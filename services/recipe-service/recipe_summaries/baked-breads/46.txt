This recipe details making Pita bread from scratch using warm water, instant yeast, bread flour, canola oil, and kosher salt. The process involves a multi-stage, extended fermentation, including initial kneading, several folding periods, and an overnight (or up to 2-day) cold proof for enhanced flavor. After dividing into 8 pieces and a final 2-4 hour room temperature rise, the dough is rolled into rounds and baked rapidly on a preheated baking stone under a hot broiler to achieve the signature puff and blistered appearance.
