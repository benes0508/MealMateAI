This recipe details a **Sour Cream Apple Pie** featuring a pastry crust filled with Granny Smith apples and a rich, spiced sour cream custard. A buttery cinnamon streusel topping is crumbled over the pie towards the end of baking, which involves an initial bake, then reducing temperature, and finally increasing it again for the topping to brown. The pie is served warm or at room temperature after cooling.
