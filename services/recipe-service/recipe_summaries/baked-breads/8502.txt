"Citrus Arancine with Pecorino Cheese" are deep-fried Italian rice balls. The recipe involves preparing a creamy risotto infused with shallots, white wine, broth, and a generous mix of orange, lemon, and lime peels, plus fennel. After cooling, the risotto is shaped around cubes of sheep's milk cheese, coated in egg and panko breadcrumbs, and chilled. The arancine are then deep-fried until golden brown and crisp, served hot, optionally garnished with citrus wedges.
