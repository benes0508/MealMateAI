This recipe for **Make-Ahead Sheet-Pan Meatballs** combines ground beef, sweet Italian sausage, soaked bread, eggs, Parmesan, and seasonings. The mixture is rolled into ping-pong sized balls and can be either:
1.  **Roasted immediately:** On oiled sheet pans at 500°F for 8-10 minutes.
2.  **Frozen for later:** Raw meatballs are frozen on sheet pans until firm, then transferred to an airtight container for up to 3 months. To cook from frozen, roast on an oiled sheet pan at 500°F for 10-12 minutes.
