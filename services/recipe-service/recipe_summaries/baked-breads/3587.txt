This recipe is for a savory Tomato-Cheddar Pie featuring a homemade, par-baked pie crust. Heirloom tomatoes are sliced and drained to remove excess moisture. The filling combines saut√©ed Vidalia onion, sharp cheddar cheese, mayonnaise (preferably Duke's), fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley, thyme), and a touch of hot sauce. The drained tomatoes are layered into the crust, topped with the cheese mixture, and baked until golden brown. The pie should be cooled to room temperature before slicing.
