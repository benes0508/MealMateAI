This recipe details how to make a Sweet Potato Souffl√© (casserole). Whole sweet potatoes are baked until soft, then peeled and mashed with eggs, granulated sugar, butter, vanilla, milk, and salt. This mixture is transferred to a baking dish and topped with a streusel-like crumble made from pecans, brown sugar, flour, and butter. The casserole is then baked until browned and rested before serving.
