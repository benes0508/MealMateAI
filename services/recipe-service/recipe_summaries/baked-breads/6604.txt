"Veggie Balls" are savory, oven-roasted vegetarian "meatballs" made from cooked lentils combined with saut√©ed vegetables (onions, carrots, celery, garlic, mushrooms, tomato paste) and bound with eggs, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and walnuts. After chilling, the mixture is rolled into balls and roasted until firm.
