This recipe for Pizza Margherita details how to make a classic pizza from scratch. It involves preparing a homemade yeast-based dough that is kneaded and allowed to rise. Concurrently, a savory tomato sauce is made by simmering pureed tomatoes with garlic, basil, sugar, and salt. Once the dough and sauce are ready, the dough is stretched, topped with the sauce and fresh mozzarella slices, and baked on a preheated pizza stone at 500Â°F until the crust is crisp and the cheese is golden and bubbling. The pizza is then cooled briefly and garnished with fresh basil before serving.
