These Breakfast Pizzas feature mini brioche dough crusts topped with crème fraîche, a bacon "wall," and caramelized onions. They are partially baked, then an egg is cracked into the center, topped with mozzarella, and baked again until the cheese is melted, the egg white is set, and the yolk is still soft.
