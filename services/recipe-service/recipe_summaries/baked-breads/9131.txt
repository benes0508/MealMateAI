Rye Walnut Rolls are yeast-leavened bread rolls made with a blend of rye and all-purpose flours. They feature cooked onion and toasted walnuts kneaded into the dough, which undergoes two rises before being shaped into 24 rolls. The rolls are then brushed with egg wash, topped with nigella or poppy seeds, and baked until golden brown.
