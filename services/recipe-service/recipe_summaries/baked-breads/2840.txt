A Lemon-Blueberry Poke Cake featuring a moist lemon cake base (baked in a loaf pan, enriched with yogurt). A vibrant blueberry filling, made by simmering blueberries with sugar and incorporating gelatin into the strained syrup, is a key element. This gelatinous filling is carefully squeezed into holes poked in the cooled cake. It's finished with a bright lemon glaze and fresh blueberry-lemon zest garnish, requiring chilling and suitable for making ahead.
