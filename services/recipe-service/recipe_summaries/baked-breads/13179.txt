Almond Crunch Cookies are a delightful dessert cookie featuring toasted slivered almonds. The unique "crunch" comes from a two-step almond preparation: some are candied and coarsely chopped for texture, while others are finely ground with flour. The dough combines butter, sugars, egg whites, amaretto, and vanilla for a rich, aromatic base. These cookies are baked until golden brown, offering a balance of tender cookie and crunchy almond bits with a hint of amaretto flavor.
