This recipe is for a **Lucca-style pizza** made with a master dough (preferably with starter/poolish). Key ingredients include hand-crushed tomatoes, oil-cured black olives, anchovies, garlic, whole milk mozzarella, fresh basil, and oregano. The pizza is baked at 500Â°F on pizza stones, with the mozzarella added initially, and the tomato-olive-anchovy mixture scattered on *after* the first bake for a final crisping, then finished with fresh basil, oregano, and olive oil.
