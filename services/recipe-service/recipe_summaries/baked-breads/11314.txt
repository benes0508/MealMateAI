This recipe is for **Gale Gand's Pinwheel Cookie Dough**, a make-ahead, slice-and-bake cookie dough. It involves preparing a standard butter cookie dough, then dividing it and incorporating melted chocolate into one half. Both vanilla and chocolate doughs are chilled, then precisely rolled out, layered, and tightly rolled into logs to create the characteristic pinwheel pattern. These logs require extensive refrigeration and freezing before being sliced and baked. The recipe provides instructions for baking from frozen, yielding approximately 20 cookies per log, or 80 cookies in total from four logs.
