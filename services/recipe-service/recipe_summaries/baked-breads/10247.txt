This recipe is for individual Caramel-Banana Bread Puddings. Slices of sandwich bread are lightly toasted, topped with caramel, and broiled until bubbly. These caramel-infused bread pieces are then arranged with banana slices in ramekins, soaked in a rich custard (eggs, half-and-half, milk, sugar, vanilla), and baked in a water bath until set. They can be made ahead and served warm or at room temperature.
