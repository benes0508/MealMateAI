A savory, bread-based **skillet stuffing** that balances sweet and tart notes with **green apples** and **dried cranberries**. It features classic aromatics (shallots, onion, celery, garlic) and fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme), moistened with chicken broth and apple cider. The dish is cooked mostly in one pan, starting on the stovetop to build flavor and then finishing in the oven for a comforting, browned side.
