This recipe details how to make BLT Wraps with a horseradish mayonnaise. Thick-cut bacon is baked on a rack over torn bread, crisping the bacon while infusing the bread with drippings for a flavorful, toasted breadcrumb topping. The dish is served deconstructed with fresh little gem lettuce leaves, halved cherry tomatoes, basil, and a zesty homemade mayonnaise featuring lemon and horseradish, allowing guests to assemble their own lettuce wraps.
