This Indian-inspired Gujarti "Lasagna" layers a spiced vegetable filling of saut√©ed eggplant, sweet potatoes, zucchini, and bell peppers, mixed with tomato masala and peanuts. Instead of pasta, it uses unique, thin sheets made from a cooked gram flour (besan) and yogurt batter. The layered dish is baked until tender and served with a traditional Kadi sauce.
