A unique baked dessert, this Lemon-Souffle Pudding Cake creates two distinct layers as it bakes: a light, airy, souffle-like cake on top and a creamy, self-saucing lemon pudding underneath. It's characterized by its bright lemon flavor and moist, delicate texture, often served with powdered sugar and fresh berries.
