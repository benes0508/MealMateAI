Apricot Hamantaschen are traditional three-cornered cookies with a sweet filling made from rehydrated dried apricots and optional walnuts. The dough, combining flour, eggs, sugar, and citrus zests, is chilled, rolled out, and cut into circles. Each circle is filled, folded into a triangular "hat" shape, brushed with an egg wash, and then baked until golden brown.
