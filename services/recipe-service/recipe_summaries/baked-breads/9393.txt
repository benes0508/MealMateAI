A gourmet twist on baked macaroni and cheese, this recipe features sweet caramelized shallots, a creamy sauce made with extrasharp cheddar and a hint of hot sauce, finished with crumbled fresh goat cheese. The dish involves separately caramelizing shallots, preparing elbow macaroni, and making a smooth, cheesy sauce on the stovetop before baking until heated through.
