This recipe for Skillet Stuffing with Apples, Shallots, and Cranberries involves finely chopping and saut√©ing a vegetable and apple mixture with butter in a skillet. Bread cubes are then added and softened, followed by chicken broth, apple cider, herbs, and dried cranberries. Finally, eggs are stirred in, and the stuffing is baked directly in the skillet until golden brown and cooked through.
