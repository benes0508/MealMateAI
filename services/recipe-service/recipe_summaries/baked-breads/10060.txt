This recipe for "Easter Bread Dolls (Pupi or Titola)" creates decorative, sweet bread figures using pre-made pinza dough. Each doll is shaped from dough ropes to form a braided body, into which a dyed Easter egg is gently pressed, topped with a small dough cross and crimped "feet." The dolls are proofed until doubled, then baked at 325Â°F. They are then brushed with an egg and sugar glaze and baked further until a deep golden brown. These festive breads can be stored for up to a week at room temperature or frozen for longer.
