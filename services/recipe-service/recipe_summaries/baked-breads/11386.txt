This recipe for Lemon Brûlée Tart involves blind-baking a sweet pastry crust, then filling it with a rich lemon custard made from cream, sugar, lemon zest and juice, and eggs. After baking until set and cooling, the tart is finished just before serving by sprinkling sugar on top and caramelizing it with a blowtorch to create a crisp brûlée topping.
