These quesadillas feature a filling of steamed and seasoned Yukon Gold potatoes mixed with Monterey Jack cheese, finely chopped mustard greens, and crumbled goat cheese, all spread on flour tortillas with a blended salsa verde and mustard green mixture. The quesadillas are folded, brushed with oil, and cooked in a skillet until golden brown, then served warm with additional salsa.
