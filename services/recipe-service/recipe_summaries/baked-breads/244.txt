This recipe details how to make Tie-Dye Butter Cookies, a decorative dessert. It involves preparing a rich butter cookie dough, cutting it into shapes, and baking until golden. The distinctive "tie-dye" effect is achieved by creating two separate glazes using plant-based food coloring, then swirling small amounts of both glazes together on a plate before dipping the cookie tops to create a unique marbled pattern. Dough and baked cookies can be prepared ahead of time.
