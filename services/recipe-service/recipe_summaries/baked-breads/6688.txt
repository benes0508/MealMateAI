Esther's Gingery Chocolate Chip Cookies are a classic cookie with a unique twist, featuring both semisweet and bittersweet chocolate chips along with finely chopped crystallized ginger for a warm, spicy note. The recipe involves standard cookie preparation, including creaming butter and sugars, then adding wet and dry ingredients, and finally folding in the chocolates and ginger. A key step is chilling the dough for at least 2 hours (up to 2 days) before baking at 375Â°F for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. They can be stored for up to 3 days.
