This recipe is for a homemade **Gorgonzola and Grape Pizza**. It involves preparing a slightly wet yeast-based pizza dough from scratch. The unique topping features red seedless grapes gently cooked in a Vin Santo reduction, combined with diced Italian Fontina and crumbled Gorgonzola Dolce cheeses, seasoned with black pepper. The pizza is assembled on parchment paper and baked on a preheated pizza stone until the crust is crisp and the cheese is golden and bubbling.
