This recipe is for **Potato Chipâ€“Crusted Magic Bars**, a sweet dessert. It features a unique crust made from crushed potato chips, flour, and butter, which is pre-baked. This is then topped with a layer of sweetened condensed milk, semi-sweet chocolate chips, coconut flakes, and chopped nuts (like smoked almonds), all baked together until golden and set. The finished bars are cooled and cut into squares.
