This recipe for Bacon-Brioche Croutons involves first rendering bacon, then adding butter to the pan. Cubed brioche or egg-enriched bread is tossed with the bacon, rendered fat, butter, salt, and pepper. The croutons are then baked until golden brown and crispy. They can be made up to two hours in advance.
