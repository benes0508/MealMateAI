**Molasses Crinkles** are a type of classic cookie characterized by their distinct, warm flavor from molasses and a blend of ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves. The dough is prepared using a creaming method, then rolled into balls, dipped on one side in sanding sugar for a glistening, crinkled finish, and baked until golden.
