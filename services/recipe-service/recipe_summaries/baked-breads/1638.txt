These "Chocolateâ€“Almond Praline Cookies" are rich, flavorful treats featuring homemade almond praline and browned butter. The process involves toasting almonds and making a caramel to create a smooth praline paste, browning butter, then combining these with sugars, egg yolk, vanilla, dry ingredients, and bittersweet chocolate. After chilling the dough, it's sliced, sprinkled with sea salt, and baked until firm. The praline paste and dough can be prepared ahead of time.
