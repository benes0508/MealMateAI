This recipe details making individual **Cupcake-Tin Pork Pies**. Ground pork is mixed with grated onion, sage, salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs to form a savory filling. Pre-made pie dough is used to line muffin tins, filled with the pork mixture, and then topped with smaller dough circles, sealed, and brushed with egg. The pies are baked at 375Â°F for 30-35 minutes until golden and can be served warm.
