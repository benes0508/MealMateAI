A Plum Galette recipe featuring pastry dough filled with a semolina-sugar mixture and plum wedges. The dough edges are folded over the fruit before baking until the plums are tender and juicy. The hot galette is then brushed with its own juices and dusted with confectioners' sugar, served warm with an optional crème fraîche and Armagnac cream.
