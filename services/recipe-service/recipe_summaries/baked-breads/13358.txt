This recipe describes a Spinach and Cheese Strata, a savory bread pudding. It involves layering cubed French/Italian bread with a sautéed mixture of spinach and onion, along with Gruyère and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. A custard made from milk, eggs, and Dijon mustard is poured over the layers. The strata is then chilled for at least 8 hours to allow the bread to absorb the custard, before being baked until puffed and golden.
