This BLT Casserole recipe transforms the classic sandwich into a comforting baked dish. It features toasted bread cubes, cooked bacon, and halved cherry tomatoes mixed with a savory custard of eggs, chicken stock, mayonnaise, and bacon fat. Romaine lettuce is stirred in before baking until golden, then briefly broiled for a glistening finish, and served immediately.
