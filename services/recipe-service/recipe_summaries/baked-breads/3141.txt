This recipe for "BA's Best Bread" describes a multi-day process to create an artisan-style loaf using whole wheat, rye, and high-protein all-purpose flours. Key steps include an overnight poolish, autolysis, intensive slap-and-fold and stretch-and-fold techniques for gluten development, and a crucial 1-2 day cold fermentation for complex flavor. The bread is baked in a very hot Dutch oven and requires a lengthy cooling period for optimal texture.
