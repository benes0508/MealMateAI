This recipe details how to make colorful Alfajores With Coconut Dulce de Leche. It involves preparing a rich, thick coconut dulce de leche from sweetened condensed and coconut milk. Separately, a butter cookie dough (featuring all-purpose and almond flours) is made, chilled, cut into shapes, and baked. Unsweetened shredded coconut is divided and colored with plant-based food dyes. The alfajores are then assembled by sandwiching the dulce de leche between two cookies, with one half brushed with honey and coated in the vibrant colored coconut.
