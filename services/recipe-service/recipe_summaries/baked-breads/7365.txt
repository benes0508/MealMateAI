This brioche recipe combines white bread flour, yeast, sugar, milk, and egg into a smooth dough, kneadable by hand or stand mixer. A key step is an overnight refrigeration, followed by a long 3-4 hour proofing period. The loaves are then glazed with an egg-milk wash and baked in a two-stage process (initially at 400°F, then 350°F) until golden brown.
