This recipe, "Meatballs: The Spuntino Way," features ground beef meatballs with a unique blend of fresh bread, garlic, parsley, Pecorino Romano, raisins, pine nuts, and eggs. The meatballs are baked at 325Â°F for 25-30 minutes until firm and juicy, then simmered in tomato sauce for about 30 minutes to absorb flavor. Serve with extra sauce and grated cheese.
