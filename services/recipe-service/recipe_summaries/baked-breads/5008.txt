Mustard-Crusted Branzino is an oven-roasted fish dish featuring whole branzino or trout topped with a savory crust made from whole grain mustard, sourdough breadcrumbs, garlic, and fresh thyme. The butterflied fish is seasoned, covered with the crust mixture, and roasted at 450Â°F for 10-15 minutes until golden and cooked through, then served with lemon wedges.
