This "Ricotta Pizza Pie" is a savory, enclosed pie with a homemade olive oil-based crust. The rich filling consists of drained ricotta, multiple eggs, grated Pecorino, salami (like sopressata), and shredded mozzarella (or similar cheese), seasoned with black pepper and Italian parsley. The pie is baked in two stages, starting at 400°F then reducing to 350°F, until puffed and golden.
