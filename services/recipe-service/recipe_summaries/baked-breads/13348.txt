This recipe details a Lavender Crème-Caramel Tart, featuring a smooth, lavender-infused custard baked in a caramel-coated pie plate. The tart is assembled by inverting a separately baked, flaky pie crust on top of the chilled crème-caramel, allowing the caramel to cascade over the edges. It combines a floral note with classic dessert techniques.
