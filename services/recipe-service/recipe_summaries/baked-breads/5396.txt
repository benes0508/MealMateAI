This recipe details how to make "Unfried Chicken with Roasted Brussels Sprouts." Chicken breasts are marinated in buttermilk and hot sauce, then coated in a seasoned panko and Parmesan mixture, and baked until cooked through. Brussels sprouts are tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roasted until caramelized and tender. Both are served together, with a squeeze of fresh lemon over the chicken.
