This recipe details how to make Raspberry-Almond Linzer Cookies. It involves toasting and grinding almonds to incorporate into a buttery sugar cookie dough base with cinnamon. The dough is chilled, then rolled out to cut 3-inch round cookies, with half of them having a 1-inch center cut out. After baking until golden, the cooled solid cookies are spread with raspberry jam, and the holed tops are dusted with confectioners' sugar before assembling into sandwich cookies.
