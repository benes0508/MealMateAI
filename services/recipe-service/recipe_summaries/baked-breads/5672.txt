This recipe is for **Savory Brioche**, a rich bread made with milk, honey, yeast, flour, eggs, and schmaltz. The process involves mixing ingredients in a stand mixer, a lengthy first fermentation, shaping the dough (e.g., into rolls or loaves), an extended refrigeration period (8-36 hours), a final room-temperature rise, and baking at 350째F (180째C) until golden brown and an internal temperature of 200째F (95째C) is reached. The dough can also be frozen after shaping for later baking.
