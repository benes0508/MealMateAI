This Buckwheat Harvest Tart features a savory crust made with buckwheat and all-purpose flour, butter, and thyme. The hearty filling combines roasted butternut squash, sautéed Swiss chard, and caramelized red onions, bound together with eggs and Gruyère cheese. The tart is blind-baked, then filled and baked again until golden and set.
