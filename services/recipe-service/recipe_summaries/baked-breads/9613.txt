This recipe is for **Brandied Plum Clafoutis**, a French baked dessert. It features plums (diced and sliced) simmered with sugar and brandy, then distributed into individual dishes. A rich batter made with cream, eggs, flour, and butter is spooned over the plums, topped with plum slices, and baked until puffed and set. It's served warm.
