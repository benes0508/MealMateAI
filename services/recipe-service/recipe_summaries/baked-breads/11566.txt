This recipe details a traditional German-style Pear Kuchen, a sweet yeast cake featuring a rich, soft dough. It's topped with tender, caramelized Bosc pears (pre-roasted with butter and brown sugar) and a fragrant brown sugar, hazelnut, and cinnamon crumb mixture. The cake undergoes two rises before being baked to a golden brown, offering a comforting blend of fruit, spice, and nutty flavors ideal as a dessert or coffee cake.
