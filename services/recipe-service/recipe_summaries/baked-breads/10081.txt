This recipe details how to make a **Pear and Almond Tart** with a flaky pastry crust. It involves preparing and blind-baking the tart shell, then filling it with brandy-tossed pear slices. An egg-based custard with crème fraîche and vanilla is poured over the pears and baked. Finally, a sliced almond and sugar topping is added and baked until golden, resulting in a rich fruit and nut dessert.
