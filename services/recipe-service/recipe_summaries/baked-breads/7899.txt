This recipe details a sophisticated lasagna made with no-cook noodles, a saut√©ed vegetable mixture of leeks, asparagus, and morel (or shiitake) mushrooms with thyme, and a creamy sauce made from chicken broth, heavy cream, and nutmeg. Layers of noodles, vegetables, sauce, and Parmesan cheese are assembled in individual baking dishes, then baked until tender and golden.
