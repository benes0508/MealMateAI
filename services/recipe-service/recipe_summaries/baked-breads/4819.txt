This Short Rib Pot Pie recipe features a rich, slow-simmered filling of tender beef short ribs, pearl onions, garlic, and tomato paste braised in red wine and herbs (rosemary, thyme). The savory filling is then topped with a flaky, homemade butter and shortening pastry crust, brushed with cream and sea salt, and baked until golden brown and bubbling. Both the crust and filling can be prepared up to two days in advance.
