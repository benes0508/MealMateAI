This recipe details how to bake an **Apple-Frangipane Galette**, a rustic, free-form tart. It involves rolling out galette dough, smearing it with frangipane (almond cream), arranging thinly sliced apples over it, and then folding the dough edges to create a border. The galette is brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with sugar before being baked at 375°F (190°C) for about an hour until golden and the apples are tender. It can be served warm or at room temperature, optionally drizzled with honey or apricot jam.
