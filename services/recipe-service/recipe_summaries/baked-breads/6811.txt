This recipe features a creamy Cauliflower Soup accompanied by aromatic Chive Oil and crispy Rye Crostini. The soup involves roasting a whole cauliflower head until tender, then simmering it with sautéed onions before puréeing and finishing with butter and cream. The chive oil is made by blanching chives, blending them with olive oil, and straining, while the crostini are rye bread slices baked with olive oil and rosemary. The dish is served warm, garnished with the crostini and a drizzle of the vibrant chive oil.
