This recipe details how to make a Pippin Apple Pie with a unique hazelnut crust. The crust is prepared by blending flour, toasted hazelnuts, brown sugar, and salt with chilled butter and lard, then chilling the resulting dough. The filling combines sliced apples (Pippin or Granny Smith) with sugar, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. The pie is assembled by spooning the apple mixture into the bottom crust, topping with the second crust, sealing, and decorating. It's then baked in stages, initially at 400°F, then reduced to 350°F, until golden and bubbling, with edges covered to prevent overbrowning. Serve cooled, ideally with vanilla ice cream.
