These Calzones with Chorizo and Kale are savory pizza pockets filled with a rich mixture of cooked chorizo, crimini mushrooms, wilted kale, and marinara sauce, combined with shredded mozzarella. The filling is encased in pizza dough, shaped into half-moons, brushed with an egg wash, and then baked until golden brown. This recipe offers options for baking immediately or freezing for later.
