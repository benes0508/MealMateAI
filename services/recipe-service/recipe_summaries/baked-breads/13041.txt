This recipe creates individual Lemon Soufflé Tartlets featuring a buttery shortbread crust. The tartlets are filled with a bright, tangy lemon-lime curd, then topped with a light and airy lemon soufflé (made by folding meringue into reserved curd). Baked until golden, they offer a delightful contrast of crisp crust, smooth curd, and fluffy topping, typically garnished with powdered sugar.
