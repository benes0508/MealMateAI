This recipe is for a **Lemon Pudding Cake**, a light and airy dessert with a distinct citrus flavor from fresh lemon zest and juice. It's made by combining a thin lemon-milk batter with stiff-peaked egg whites, then baked in a hot water bath until puffed and golden. It can be served warm or at room temperature.
