This recipe details how to make a **Brown-Butter Pecan Pie with Rum and Espresso**. It involves preparing a **flaky butter and shortening pie crust** from scratch, chilling it, and then rolling it out into a 9-inch pie shell. The unique filling is made by browning butter until nutty, then whisking it with brown sugar, cane syrup, salt, vanilla, **dark rum**, and **instant espresso powder**, followed by beaten eggs and chopped pecans. Whole pecans are arranged on top for decoration. The pie is baked at 375Â°F, starting on the bottom rack and moving to the center, until golden and set (about 40-45 minutes total). It requires cooling completely for about 3 hours before slicing and can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.
