Pan de Muerto is a traditional Mexican sweet bread made with flour, sugar, yeast, eggs, butter, and orange zest. The dough is prepared with a starter and undergoes two rises. Distinctively, it's shaped into rounds topped with dough "bones" to form a crossbones pattern. The bread is baked until golden, then brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with sugar.
