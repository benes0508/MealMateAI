Baked Alaska Saint Pierre is an elaborate dessert featuring layers of orange-zest sponge cake, marmalade-infused vanilla ice cream, and orange sorbet, assembled and frozen firm. It is then covered with a voluminous meringue, briefly baked at high heat to achieve a browned exterior, and dramatically finished by flaming Grand Marnier poured over the meringue just before serving.
