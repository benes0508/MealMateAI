This is a Double-Decker Chocolate and Cherry-Raspberry Birthday Pie, an intricate dessert combining two distinct pies. A rich chocolate pie forms the base layer, while a sweet-tart cherry-raspberry and walnut pie sits on top. Both pies are baked with a double crust. After baking and extensive chilling, the pies are stacked with a cream-based icing between them and decorated with piped Royal Icing, making it a celebratory and visually impressive treat.
