This recipe is for a large Blueberry Peach Slab Pie. It features a butter-based double crust filled with a mixture of sliced peaches and blueberries, sweetened with sugar and flavored with vanilla and lemon. The preparation involves making two batches of pie dough, blanching and preparing the fruit filling, assembling the pie on a large baking sheet, and baking it in two stages until the crust is golden and the fruit filling is bubbling. The pie requires cooling for at least two hours before slicing and serving.
