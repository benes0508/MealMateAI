Mascarpone and Prune Tartlets are individual sweet pastry desserts. They feature a creamy mascarpone, egg yolk, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla custard, complemented by prunes rehydrated and infused with Armagnac. The recipe involves blind-baking sweet pastry shells, preparing the prune and custard fillings, assembling them in the shells, and then baking until the custard is set and lightly puffed.
