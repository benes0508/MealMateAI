This recipe creates a **Carrot Pizza with Fontina and Red Onion**. It features a unique base made by cooking and puréeing carrots and onions with mascarpone. Pizza dough is pre-baked, then topped with this creamy carrot purée, grated Fontina cheese, and fresh, thinly sliced red onion. The pizza is then baked until golden and bubbly, and garnished with carrot fronds or arugula.
