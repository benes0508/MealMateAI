This recipe details how to make **Buckwheat Blinis with Smoked Salmon and Crème Fraîche**. It involves preparing a yeast-leavened batter from all-purpose and buckwheat flours, milk, butter, and eggs, which is then proofed and cooked on a griddle into small pancakes (blinis). The warm blinis are served topped with crème fraîche, thinly sliced smoked salmon, salmon roe, and fresh dill sprigs. Both the blini batter and cooked blinis can be prepared ahead of time.
