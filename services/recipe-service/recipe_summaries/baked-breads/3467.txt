This recipe details how to make a **Vegan Pumpkin Pie**. It involves preparing a homemade vegan pie crust from scratch (using chilled vegan butter, flour, and a specific mixing process), pre-baking it, and then creating a smooth, spiced filling from silken tofu, pumpkin pur√©e, vegan cream cheese, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla extract. The filling is poured into the pre-baked crust and baked until set, then cooled and refrigerated before serving.
