This recipe details how to make savory Herbed Garlic and Parmesan Croutons. Italian bread cubes are first tossed with olive oil infused with garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper. These seasoned bread cubes are then baked until golden and crisp, finished with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, and baked briefly again for a final golden touch.
