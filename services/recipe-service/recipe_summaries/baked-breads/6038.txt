This recipe for "Latkes with Lots of Sauces" features classic potato pancakes served with two distinct accompaniments: a savory sour cream, lox, and chive sauce, and a sweet applesauce-based sauce with cinnamon, ginger, and sugars. The latkes are made by shredding and thoroughly drying potatoes and onions, then mixing them with eggs, flour, chives, and garlic, forming thin pancakes, and frying them until golden brown. They are served immediately with the pre-made sauces.
