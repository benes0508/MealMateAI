This recipe details how to make elegant Upside Down Apple Tarts featuring a rich vanilla bean pastry cream, crisp Golden Delicious apple slices, and flaky puff pastry. The process involves preparing the pastry cream, assembling the tarts with puff pastry rounds, piping the cream, and arranging apples. They are baked until the apples are tender and the pastry golden, then flipped, glazed with a corn syrup mixture, and baked again for a shiny finish. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with vanilla ice cream.
