This recipe creates individual **Cornbread Stuffing Muffins** with a savory blend of dried cornbread and white bread cubes, saut√©ed leeks, celery, and smoked ham. Seasoned generously with sage, thyme, and parsley, the mixture is bound with eggs and chicken broth, then baked in muffin tins until golden. It's a convenient, make-ahead friendly side dish.
