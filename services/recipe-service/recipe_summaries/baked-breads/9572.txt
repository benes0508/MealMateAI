This recipe details how to make Espresso Blackberry Macarons. It involves grinding almond flour with confectioners' sugar, preparing an espresso-vanilla mixture, and then creating a meringue from egg whites, salt, and granulated sugar. The espresso mixture is incorporated into the meringue, which is then folded into the almond mixture to form a batter. The batter is piped into small mounds, allowed to form a crust, baked, and then cooled. Finally, two macaron shells are sandwiched together with blackberry jelly. The recipe also includes several variations like Chocolate Earl Grey, Grapefruit, Coconut Passion-Fruit, and Pistachio-Cardamom macarons.
