Coconut-Lime Bars with Hazelnut Shortbread Crust feature a toasted hazelnut shortbread base, baked until golden. A tangy lime filling (eggs, lime juice, sugar, flour, lime peel) is poured over the cooled crust and partially baked before sweetened flaked coconut is added and baked until set. The bars require significant chilling (at least 2 hours) before serving.
