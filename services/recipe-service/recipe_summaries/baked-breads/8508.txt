This recipe details how to create Spiced Pear Flatbreads with Goat Cheese and Mustard Cream. It involves preparing a yeast-based dough that requires mixing, resting, and chilling, alongside a tangy mustard cream sauce. Thinly sliced Bosc pears are spiced and arranged with arugula and crumbled goat cheese on the rolled flatbread dough. The flatbreads are then baked on a hot pizza stone at 500Â°F until golden and crisp, and served drizzled with the mustard cream.
