This recipe is for a flavorful shortbread combining savory fresh thyme, bright lemon zest, and coarse sea salt. The dough is made by rubbing butter into dry ingredients, then lightly mixing in an egg mixture before chilling. It's then rolled out, cut into strips, brushed with egg wash, topped with sea salt, and baked at 350Â°F for about 20 minutes until lightly browned. They can be stored for up to a week.
