This recipe for "Glowing Jack-o'-Lantern Cookies" describes how to make decorative sugar cookies with a unique stained-glass effect. It involves making an orange-tinted sugar cookie dough, cutting it into jack-o'-lantern shapes, and then filling the cut-out eyes, nose, and mouth with crushed hard candies. When baked, the candies melt to create translucent, glowing features, giving the cookies a festive Halloween look.
