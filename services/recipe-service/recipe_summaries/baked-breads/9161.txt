**Rosemary Flat Bread** is a rustic, yeast-leavened bread recipe combining bread and whole wheat flours. It involves multiple rises and is shaped into a rectangular flatbread. The dough is dimpled and generously topped with fresh rosemary, coarse sea salt, and black pepper before being baked at a high temperature (475Â°F) with added steam for a crisp crust. A stand mixer is recommended for the sticky dough, and an optional overnight refrigeration method is provided.
