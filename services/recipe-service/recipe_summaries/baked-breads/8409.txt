This recipe details how to make a "Crispy Braeburn Apple and Almond Sheet Tart." It features a rich almond cream (made from almond flour, sugar, egg, heavy cream, and vanilla) that is chilled. A crispy base is created by layering 8 sheets of phyllo pastry, each brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with sugar. The almond cream is spread over the phyllo, topped with thinly sliced Braeburn apples arranged in rows. The tart is baked until golden and set, then finished with a warm apricot preserve glaze. It can be served warm or at room temperature.
