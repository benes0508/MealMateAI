This recipe details how to make a "Black Bottom Oatmeal Pie" featuring a homemade, blind-baked pie crust. It consists of two main layers: a rich bittersweet chocolate ganache spread at the bottom, topped with a sweet, spiced filling made from toasted rolled oats, brown sugar, corn syrup, ginger, and eggs. The pie is baked until set and then cooled completely before serving.
