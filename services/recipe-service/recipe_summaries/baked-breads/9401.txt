This recipe details a **Sweet Ricotta Pudding with Roasted Grapes**. The pudding is made by blending ricotta, eggs, cinnamon, salt, and sugar, pouring it into a buttered, bread-crumbed pie plate, topping with pine nuts, and baking until golden. Separately, red seedless grapes are tossed with butter, sugar, and balsamic vinegar, macerated, and then roasted until tender. The cooled pudding is served with the warm roasted grapes.
