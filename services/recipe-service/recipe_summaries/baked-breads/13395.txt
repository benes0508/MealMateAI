This recipe details how to make **Baked Brie with Caramelized Onions**. It involves caramelizing onions with butter, thyme, garlic, white wine, and a touch of sugar until rich and brown. A wheel of Brie cheese (with its top rind removed and kept in its wooden box) is then topped with these onions and baked at 350Â°F for about 30 minutes until melted. Serve immediately with sliced French bread baguettes.
