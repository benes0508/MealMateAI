This recipe is for Anise Sesame Cookies. It involves soaking anise seeds, then creaming butter and sugar, adding eggs and the soaked anise. Dry ingredients are mixed in, and the dough is chilled for about 3 hours. Cookies are then rolled out, cut with a fluted cutter, brushed with an egg wash, and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. They are baked at 350Â°F for 10-12 minutes until golden.
