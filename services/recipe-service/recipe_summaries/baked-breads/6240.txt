Nonna Mary's Ciambella is an Italian sweet loaf prepared by blending flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, baking powder, and lemon zest in a food processor to form a dough. The dough is then shaped into a 12-inch loaf, scored, brushed with an egg yolk wash, and baked at 375Â°F for 35 minutes until golden brown.
