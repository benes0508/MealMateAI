This recipe makes sweet Pumpkin Turnovers (Empanadas) featuring a homemade pumpkin filling and a soft pastry dough. The filling is prepared by steaming, mashing, and simmering pumpkin with cinnamon, cloves, and dark brown sugar (piloncillo) until thick, then chilled. The dough is a simple mix of flour, shortening, eggs, and milk. The turnovers are assembled by filling rolled dough circles with the pumpkin mixture, sealing, brushing with milk/egg wash, and baking at 350Â°F until golden.
