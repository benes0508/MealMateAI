This recipe details making "Salsa Verde With Toasted Breadcrumbs." It involves preparing golden, crisp breadcrumbs from torn country-style bread (baked then pan-fried in olive oil and crushed), and a savory salsa verde made by mashing anchovies, garlic, and capers into a paste, then mixing with red wine vinegar, parsley, and olive oil. The two components are combined just before serving, seasoned with salt and pepper. Both can be prepared ahead: breadcrumbs a day in advance, and the salsa verde (without breadcrumbs) up to 4 hours prior and chilled.
