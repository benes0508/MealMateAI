**Deviled Chicken Drumsticks:** Chicken drumsticks are coated first with Dijon mustard, then dredged in a crispy, savory mixture of panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, and cayenne pepper. They are then roasted at 450Â°F for about 30 minutes until browned and cooked through. Serve warm or at room temperature.
