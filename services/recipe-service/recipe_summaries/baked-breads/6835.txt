A savory Sourdough, Wild Mushroom, and Bacon Dressing, essentially a stuffing-like side dish. It features toasted sourdough bread cubes combined with roasted wild mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, cremini), crispy bacon, and an aromatic liquid base made from chicken stock, saut√©ed onions, garlic, sage, thyme, and parsley, all bound with eggs and baked until golden brown.
