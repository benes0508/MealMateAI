These unique Ancho Mole Cookies feature a rich dough infused with ancho chile powder, agave, and cinnamon, creating a complex sweet and savory flavor. They are generously studded with toasted nuts, tropical dried fruits, and bittersweet chocolate. A distinguishing characteristic is their triangular shape, achieved by a special log-shaping method, and a generous coating of sesame seeds before baking.
