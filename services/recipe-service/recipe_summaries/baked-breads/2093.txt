This recipe features pasta triangles tossed with tender baby artichokes, a creamy mascarpone and lemon sauce, and a crunchy topping of toasted hazelnuts, marjoram/oregano, and Aleppo pepper. The artichokes are gently cooked with garlic and bay leaves, while the pasta is combined with the mascarpone sauce and artichokes, then finished with the flavorful hazelnut mixture.
