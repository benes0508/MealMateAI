This recipe creates a Rustic Lemon Tart (Torta Della Nonna al Limone) accompanied by delicate Pine Nut Lace Cookies. The tart features a lemon-infused, shortbread-style crust filled with a creamy, tangy lemon custard, baked until just set, then thoroughly chilled. The separate pine nut lace cookies are thin, crisp, and nutty, serving as an edible garnish alongside toasted pine nuts and candied lemon zest. This multi-component dessert offers a delightful balance of sweet, tart, and nutty flavors, ideal for a special occasion.
