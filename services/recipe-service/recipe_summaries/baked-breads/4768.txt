This recipe describes how to make Klobasnek, a savory Czech pastry also known as Sausage Kolaches. It involves preparing a soft yeast dough, allowing it to rise twice, then wrapping pieces of smoked kielbasa sausage, cheddar cheese, and optional pickled jalape√±os within the dough. The assembled pastries are baked until golden brown and brushed with melted butter for a rich finish. They are best served warm.
