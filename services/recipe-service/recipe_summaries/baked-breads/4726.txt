Parisian Gnocchi are delicate gnocchi made from a pâte à choux (choux pastry) dough, rather than traditional potato. The recipe involves preparing the choux dough, shaping and par-poaching the gnocchi, and making a creamy Mornay sauce with Swiss and Parmesan cheeses. The gnocchi are then layered in a baking dish with the Mornay, topped generously with more cheese, and baked until golden brown and bubbly.
