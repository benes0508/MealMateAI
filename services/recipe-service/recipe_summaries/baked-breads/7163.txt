Red Velvet Chocolate Squares are a unique dessert or snack made with canned beets and red beans for natural color and texture, combined with cocoa powder, whole wheat pastry flour, and agave nectar. The ingredients are processed into a smooth batter, baked, then chilled before being cut into squares.
