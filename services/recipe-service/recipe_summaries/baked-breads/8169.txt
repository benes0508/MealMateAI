This recipe is for "Poppy Cheddar Moon Crackers," a savory snack featuring a blend of all-purpose flour and cornmeal, mixed with poppy seeds and extra-sharp cheddar cheese. The dough is made with cold butter, chilled, then rolled out and cut into crescent shapes. The crackers are brushed with an egg wash, sprinkled with sea salt, and baked until golden and crisp.
