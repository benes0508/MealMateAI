This recipe features a rich **Pistachio and Almond Cake** served alongside a vibrant **Orange Salad**. The cake is a dense loaf made with finely ground pistachios and almonds, enriched with butter, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla. The accompanying salad consists of fresh orange slices dressed with a warm, thinned orange marmalade and lemon juice syrup. The dish is served with warm cake slices next to the chilled orange salad, garnished with yogurt and pistachios.
