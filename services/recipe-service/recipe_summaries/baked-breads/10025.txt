This recipe for Gluten-Free Pizza features a yeast-leavened dough made with a blend of tapioca, white rice, chickpea, and sorghum flours, plus xanthan gum. It includes instructions for a simple, simmered tomato sauce. The dough is patted into rounds, allowed to rise, and pre-baked on a pizza stone for a crisp crust (which can be made ahead). Pizzas are then topped with the homemade sauce, fresh mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and olive oil, before being broiled until bubbly and golden, and garnished with fresh basil.
