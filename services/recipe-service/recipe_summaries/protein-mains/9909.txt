These Summer Rolls feature a lean ground turkey filling seasoned with Asian sauces, combined with cellophane noodles, fresh bell peppers, shiitake mushrooms, and mung bean sprouts, all wrapped in pliable rice paper. The turkey mixture is cooked until crumbly, then assembled with the other ingredients in rice paper wrappers and rolled.
