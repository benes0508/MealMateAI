This Lean Lasagna recipe features a healthier twist on the classic, using ground turkey breast, whole wheat lasagna noodles, fat-free ricotta, and part-skim mozzarella. It involves cooking a savory turkey and mushroom tomato sauce, preparing a spinach-ricotta mixture, boiling the noodles, then layering these components in a baking dish before baking until bubbly.
