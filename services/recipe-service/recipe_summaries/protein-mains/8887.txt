This recipe features **bone-in heritage pork rib chops** seasoned with salt, thyme, rosemary, and pepper. The chops are first **seared** in a skillet with bacon drippings until browned, then transferred to a baking sheet. Leeks and garlic are sautéed in the same skillet, followed by brandy and chicken broth to deglaze. The chops are then **simmered** with the leek mixture until cooked through. A **mustard sauce** is made by reducing the pan liquid, then whisking in Dijon mustard and crème fraîche, which is spooned over the finished chops.
