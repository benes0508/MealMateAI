This recipe details a classic Three Cities of Spain Cheesecake, featuring a graham cracker crust, a rich cream cheese filling, and a tangy sour cream topping. It's baked in two stages, first the filling until set, then briefly with the sour cream topping, followed by extensive cooling and chilling before serving.
