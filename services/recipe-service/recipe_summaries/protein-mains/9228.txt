This recipe for **Sunday Rag√π** is a hearty, slow-cooked Italian meat sauce. It features a rich tomato base simmered with aromatics, into which a variety of browned meats are added: beef braciole (thinly sliced beef rolled with a parsley, cheese, and pancetta filling), sweet and hot Italian sausages, boneless pork shoulder, country-style pork ribs, and meatballs. The sauce and meats are then simmered together for over two hours until tender, typically served with fresh egg fettuccine.
