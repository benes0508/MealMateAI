A savory Carrot Tart featuring a crisp puff pastry base topped with a creamy ricotta spread. It's generously layered with thinly sliced, tender-baked carrots and caramelized onions, and finished with fresh chives and dill for a bright herby flavor. This vegetarian tart is baked to golden perfection and can be prepared ahead of time.
