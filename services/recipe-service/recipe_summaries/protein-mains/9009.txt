A hearty Italian pasta and bean soup, 'Pasta e Fagioli con Salsicce,' featuring ground Italian sausage. The recipe requires pre-soaking and simmering cannellini beans until tender. These are then combined with browned Italian sausage, sautÃ©ed onion, garlic, and fresh rosemary, simmered in chicken stock. Small tubular pasta is cooked separately and stirred in just before serving, creating a comforting, rustic meal.
