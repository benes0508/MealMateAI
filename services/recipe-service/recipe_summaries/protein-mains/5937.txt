This recipe details a multi-day process for preparing a Brined Roast Turkey Breast with Confit Legs. The turkey legs and wings are seasoned, then slow-cooked in duck fat (confit method) until tender, chilled, and later crisped. Separately, the turkey breast is brined overnight in a spiced solution, then roasted in the oven until cooked through, and rested before serving alongside the re-warmed and browned confit legs.
