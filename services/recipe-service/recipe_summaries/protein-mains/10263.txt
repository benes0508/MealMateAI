This recipe details how to make breakfast pizzas using ciabatta bread as the base. Ciabatta halves are brushed with green onion-infused olive oil, topped with Monterey Jack cheese and saut√©ed crumbled Italian sausage, then baked until the cheese melts and bread crisps. Separately fried eggs are placed on top after baking, and the pizzas are finished with reserved onion oil before being cut into servings.
