This recipe details a Classic Potato Gratin. Thinly sliced russet potatoes are layered in a buttered dish, covered with a creamy, blended sauce made from simmered heavy cream, shallots, and garlic, then baked until tender. Finally, it's topped with Gruyere and Parmesan cheese and broiled until golden brown and bubbling. The dish can be prepared a day in advance.
