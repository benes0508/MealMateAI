This recipe features tender baked sweet potatoes generously topped with a rich, Cuban-style ground beef picadillo. The flavorful picadillo combines lean ground beef with aromatics like onion, garlic, cumin, and cinnamon, simmered with crushed tomatoes, dry sherry, sweet-tart dried cherries, and briny pimento olives and capers for a unique sweet and savory profile. A hearty and complete main course.
