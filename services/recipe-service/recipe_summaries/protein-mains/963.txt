This recipe for "Turkey for Twenty" focuses on roasting individual turkey pieces (legs, thighs, and split breasts) for a large group. It features a dry brine using kosher salt, brown sugar, and black pepper, followed by a basting process with herb-infused butter (rosemary, sage, thyme, garlic). The turkey is roasted at a high temperature (450°F) until the breast reaches 150°F and the thigh reaches 165°F, served with the roasted garlic.
