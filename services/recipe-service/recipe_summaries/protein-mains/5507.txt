Chinese Orange Chicken features crispy, deep-fried chicken thighs coated in a vibrant, sweet, tangy, and savory orange sauce. The sauce is made with fresh orange juice and dried zest, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, ginger, and a touch of crushed red pepper. The cornstarch-coated chicken is deep-fried, then tossed in the simmering sauce until thoroughly coated and typically served immediately with rice.
