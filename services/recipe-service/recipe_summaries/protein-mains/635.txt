This recipe for "Make-Ahead Instant Pot Grilled Ribs" features St. Louis style pork spareribs seasoned with a dry rub of peppercorns, cumin, red pepper flakes, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon. The ribs are pressure-cooked in an Instant Pot with white wine, then the cooking liquid is reduced into a flavorful sauce with vinegar and garlic. Finally, the ribs are grilled until lightly charred, basted with the reduced sauce, and garnished with fresh herbs. The pressure-cooked ribs can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
