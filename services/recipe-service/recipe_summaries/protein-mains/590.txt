This recipe features a whole head of cauliflower that is first pre-cooked (microwaved or steamed) until tender. It's then brushed with a savory sauce made from butter, hot sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce, and grilled until charred and fork-tender. The dish is finished by serving it on a bed of creamy miso-mayonnaise and garnished with sliced scallions.
