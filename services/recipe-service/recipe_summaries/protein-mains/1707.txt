"Clam Toasts with Pancetta" is a savory appetizer or light meal featuring toasted sourdough bread topped with a rich mixture of clams, crispy pancetta, and an aromatic soffritto (saut√©ed onion, fennel, and garlic with white wine and herbs). The clams are cooked in the skillet with the soffritto until open, then spooned over garlic-rubbed toast and finished with a drizzle of olive oil and red pepper flakes.
