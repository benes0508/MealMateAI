This recipe details a Japanese-style udon noodle soup featuring chicken, a variety of vegetables (carrots, snow peas, napa cabbage, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, scallions), and shellfish (littleneck clams, shrimp). Udon noodles are served in a savory dashi, soy sauce, and mirin broth, which is also used to simmer the chicken, mushrooms, clams, and shrimp until cooked. Vegetables are blanched separately and added to the bowls with the noodles before the hot broth and proteins are ladled over.
