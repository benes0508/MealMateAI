This recipe details how to prepare a White Fish Terrine with Salmon Roe and Dill. Chilled white fish (cod, scrod, or gray sole) is pur√©ed with seasonings and egg white, then strained for a smooth texture. Heavy cream is incorporated, and the mixture is divided: one part with fresh dill, the other with salmon roe. These are layered in a terrine mold (salmon roe mixture on the outside, dill mixture as a core) and baked in a water bath until firm. The terrine is then cooled, unmolded, and sliced for serving, often accompanied by beurre blanc.
