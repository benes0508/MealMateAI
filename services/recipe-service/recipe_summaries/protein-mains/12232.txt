This recipe details a Polenta and Sausage Stuffing, a savory baked dish. It uniquely combines creamy mashed polenta with crispy, broiled polenta cubes. Savory crumbled Italian sausage is cooked with onion and garlic, then mixed with the prepared polenta, chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley, before being baked until golden and heated through.
