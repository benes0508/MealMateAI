Pan-Fried Fishcakes are savory, crispy-on-the-outside patties made from mild white fish (like cod), a creamy fish purée, and a sautéed mirepoix of onion, carrot, and celery. Flavored with lime zest, fresh cilantro, and optional jalapeño, the mixture is formed into patties, breaded, and then pan-fried until golden brown. They are finished with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
