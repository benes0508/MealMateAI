This recipe details how to make **Homemade Turkey Stock** using roasted turkey wings, saut√©ed onion, carrot, and celery, along with parsley, thyme, peppercorns, and bay leaf. The process involves browning the wings in an oven, deglazing the pan, then simmering all ingredients with water for 3 hours. After simmering, the stock is strained, cooled, and fat is skimmed off, making it ready for immediate use or storage (refrigerated up to 2 days, frozen up to 6 months).
