This Asian-inspired recipe features chicken marinated in sherry, cornstarch, and ginger, stir-fried with broccoli and nuts (almonds/cashews), then simmered in a savory-sweet sauce made with kecap manis/soy sauce and chicken stock. A key element is the crispy, deep-fried rice noodles, which are served on top for texture.
