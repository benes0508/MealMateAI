This recipe is for a New England Clam and Corn Chowder. It features bacon, sautéed onion and carrots, potatoes, canned chopped clams with their juice, and canned corn, all cooked in a milky, herb-seasoned broth (thyme, rosemary, parsley). The bacon is cooked first, then vegetables are sautéed in the drippings, followed by the addition of flour, milk, and the main ingredients, simmering until the potatoes are tender. It's served garnished with the cooked bacon and fresh parsley.
