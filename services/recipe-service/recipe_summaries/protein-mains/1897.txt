This recipe is for **3-Ingredient Garlic-Herb Grilled Chicken Wings**. Chicken wings are marinated in a blend of finely grated garlic, chopped herbs (rosemary, thyme, or oregano), oil, salt, and pepper. After chilling for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight), the wings are grilled using a two-zone method (medium then medium-high heat) until they are crisp, lightly charred, and cooked through to 165Â°F.
