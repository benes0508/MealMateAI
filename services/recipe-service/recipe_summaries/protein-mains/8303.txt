This "Potato and Autumn Vegetable Hash" is a hearty roasted vegetable dish featuring a mix of russet potatoes, yams, butternut squash, and two types of baby beets. It involves preparing an herb-infused olive oil, blanching beet greens, and separately roasting the beets until tender. The squash, potatoes, and yams are then roasted together. Finally, all the roasted vegetables, along with the blanched beet greens and butter, are combined and briefly roasted to heat through before serving.
