This recipe for "Expertly Spiced and Glazed Roast Turkey" guides you through spatchcocking a whole turkey, followed by a **24-48 hour dry brine** using a custom blend of black and pink peppercorns, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and brown sugar. A separate **sweet and savory glaze** is prepared from herbs, garlic, orange zest, soy sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar. The turkey is then roasted in a two-stage process: an initial high-heat blast (425°F) for browning, followed by a lower temperature (300°F) roast where it's repeatedly brushed with the glaze until cooked through. A final resting period ensures a juicy result.
