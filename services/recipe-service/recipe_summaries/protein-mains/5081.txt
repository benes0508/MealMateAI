This recipe details how to prepare **Fried Ipswich Whole Belly Clams**. Clams are first blotted dry, then coated using a standard breading procedure (flour, beaten egg, then a mixture of cracker meal, bread crumbs, cornmeal, and Old Bay seasoning). They are then deep-fried in batches until golden brown and crisp, served hot with tartar sauce.
