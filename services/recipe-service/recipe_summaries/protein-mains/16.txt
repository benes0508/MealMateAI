Enfrijoladas is a traditional Mexican dish featuring corn tortillas thoroughly coated in a rich, savory black bean pur√©e. They are filled with browned chorizo sausage and crumbled queso fresco (or cotija cheese). Served warm, it's often topped with fresh cilantro, sliced avocado, and additional onion and cheese, offering a hearty and comforting meal.
