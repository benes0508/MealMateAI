This is a classic Louisiana-style Jambalaya featuring ham, chicken, and shrimp, cooked with the "holy trinity" of onion, bell pepper, and celery, along with garlic and parsley. It's prepared in a tomato-based sauce with brown rice, spiced with cayenne pepper, and cooked until the rice absorbs the flavorful liquid, with shrimp added at the end.
