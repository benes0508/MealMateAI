This recipe is for **Crispy Spring Rolls (Cha Gio)**, a Vietnamese deep-fried dish. It features a savory filling of ground chicken and pork, bean thread noodles, tree ear mushrooms, and fresh vegetables (onions, carrots, green onions), seasoned with fish sauce, garlic, and spices. The filling is wrapped in diagonally cut spring roll wrappers, sealed with a cornstarch "glue," and deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. They are served immediately with Vietnamese dipping sauce and a table salad, often enjoyed wrapped in lettuce leaves with cucumber and mint.
