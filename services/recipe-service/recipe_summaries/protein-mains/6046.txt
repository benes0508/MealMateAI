This recipe details how to make "Breaded Chicken Cutlets" (Grandma Jody's Chicken). Boneless chicken breasts are pounded thin, dredged in flour, then egg, then seasoned breadcrumbs, and finally pan-fried in olive oil for 3-4 minutes per side until firm. The cooked cutlets are drained on paper towels.
