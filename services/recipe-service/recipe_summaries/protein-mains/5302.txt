This recipe features pan-seared halibut, marinated in herbs and wrapped in caul fat, finished in the oven. It's served with a creamy arborio rice risotto, enriched with Parmesan, butter, herbs, and topped with blanched, butter-sautéed white asparagus. A vibrant pea and spinach purée with a hint of lemon completes the dish.
