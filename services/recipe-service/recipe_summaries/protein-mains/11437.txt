"Chicks in Blankets" are a savory appetizer featuring chicken or chicken andouille sausage rounds wrapped in puff pastry with Dijon mustard. The pastry-wrapped sausages are glazed with an egg-milk wash and baked until golden and puffed. They can be prepared up to 8 hours in advance and are served warm.
