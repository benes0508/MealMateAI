This "Anything Goes Donabe" is a Japanese hot pot featuring a dashi-based broth with mirin and soy sauce. It includes bean thread noodles, napa cabbage, littleneck clams, jumbo shrimp, red snapper or black bass, chicken thigh, firm tofu, oyster and enoki mushrooms, and carrots. Ingredients are layered in a donabe (or Dutch oven) with the broth, simmered until cooked through, and served topped with thinly sliced, curled scallions.
