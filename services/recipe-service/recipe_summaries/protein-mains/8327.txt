This recipe details how to prepare a whole **clementine-salted turkey**, dry-brined overnight for enhanced flavor and moisture, then roasted until golden. It's served with a unique, rich **Redeye Gravy** made from the turkey's pan drippings, country ham (or bacon), and freshly brewed coffee. Ideal for a holiday or special occasion main course.
