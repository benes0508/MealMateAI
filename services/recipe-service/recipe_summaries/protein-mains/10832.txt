Grilled Eggplant Parmigiana is a lighter, grilled take on the classic dish. Thinly sliced eggplant is grilled until tender, then topped with a quick tomato sauce (featuring garlic, red pepper flakes, basil, and parmesan) and a slice of mozzarella. The assembled stacks are briefly grilled again to melt the cheese.
