This recipe details a savory stew where bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are first crisped by searing, then simmered with a flavorful mix of red onion, garlic, lemon, capers, artichoke hearts, and Kalamata olives in a white wine and chicken bone broth base. The chicken is deboned and returned to the stew before serving.
