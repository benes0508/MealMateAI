This recipe is for classic Fish-and-Chips, featuring deep-fried cod fillets and double-fried russet potato chips. The cod is first dredged in rice flour, then coated in a batter made with all-purpose flour, baking powder, eggs, and soda water. Both the pre-fried chips and the battered fish are deep-fried together at 375Â°F until golden and crispy, then seasoned with salt and pepper.
