This recipe for "Set-It-and-Forget-It Roast Pork Shoulder" outlines a slow-roasting method for an 8-10 lb bone-in pork shoulder. It involves preparing a spice rub of ground peppercorns, juniper, coriander, salt, and sugar, then scoring the pork skin in a crosshatch pattern and rubbing the spices thoroughly into the fat and meat. After marinating for 3 hours to 3 days, the pork is slow-roasted at 225Â°F for 9-10 hours over rosemary, garlic, white wine, and water, until the meat is falling off the bone and the skin is dark. The roast is then rested and can be briefly reheated before serving warm with cranberry sauce, cornichons, and whole grain mustard.
