This recipe features roasted pork tenderloin, seared then oven-finished, served with a creamy butternut squash mash flavored with nutmeg and agave. A savory tarragon gravy, made with applesauce, Dijon mustard, and apple cider, is prepared in the same pan as the pork. Toasted walnuts are sprinkled on top for garnish.
