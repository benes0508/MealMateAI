**Eggplant Omelet (Tortang Talong)**

This recipe details how to make a Filipino-style eggplant omelet. Eggplants are first broiled or roasted until soft and blackened, then peeled and flattened. They are then dipped in seasoned beaten eggs and pan-fried until golden and crispy. Optionally, cooked crabmeat can be added on top during cooking. Serve hot or at room temperature, with fish sauce.
