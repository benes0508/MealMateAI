Brad's Campsite Jambalaya is a hearty one-pot Cajun dish featuring chicken thighs, Andouille sausage, and shrimp. It's cooked with the 'holy trinity' (onion, bell pepper, celery), garlic, and cherry tomatoes, then simmered with long-grain white rice, chicken broth, and Creole seasoning until tender. Ideal for outdoor cooking on a grill, it's finished with fresh parsley.
