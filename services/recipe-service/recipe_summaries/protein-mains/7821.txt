A flavorful Middle Eastern-inspired dish featuring braised chicken thighs and brown basmati rice. The chicken is browned and simmered, creating a rich stock. Separately, a unique aromatic syrup is made with orange zest, saffron, slivered almonds, pistachios, rose water, and cardamom. This syrup is combined with the chicken stock to cook the rice. The braised chicken is then folded into the cooked rice (along with optional fava beans and peas) and baked until tender. The dish is garnished with reserved orange zest and nuts.
