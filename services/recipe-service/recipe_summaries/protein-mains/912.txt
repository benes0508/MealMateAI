Hanukkah Chicken is a festive dish featuring seared chicken thighs simmered in a rich sauce of caramelized apples, white wine, and applesauce. It's served alongside a large, crispy golden-brown potato and onion latke, cooked in a skillet and finished under the broiler. The dish is brightened with fresh lemon juice, parsley, and lemon zest.
