This recipe details how to make **Garlic Soup with Poached Eggs**. It involves saut√©ing sliced garlic until tender, toasting baguette slices in the same pan, then simmering chicken stock with the cooked garlic and red pepper flakes. Finally, eggs are poached directly in the simmering broth. The dish is served by placing toast in bowls, topping with a poached egg, and then ladling the garlic soup over, garnished with fresh cilantro and lime wedges.
