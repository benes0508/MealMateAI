These Cheddar-Stuffed Turkey Burgers feature ground turkey patties infused with Worcestershire sauce and black pepper, then stuffed with diced sharp cheddar. They are grilled until cooked through and served on ciabatta rolls or whole wheat buns with caramelized onions, romaine, avocado, optional pickled jalape√±os, and a homemade Salsa Ranch Dip made from Greek yogurt, salsa, and fresh herbs.
