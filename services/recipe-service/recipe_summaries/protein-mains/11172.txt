This recipe for Spice-Rubbed Duck Legs Braised with Green Olives and Carrots features duck legs seasoned overnight with a toasted spice blend (coriander, fennel, cumin, black peppercorns). The duck is then seared until crisp, deglazed with brandy and dry white wine, and slow-braised in chicken broth with onions, garlic, lemon peel, bay leaves, carrots, and brine-cured green olives until fall-off-the-bone tender. The dish is finished by reducing the braising liquid into a rich sauce and broiling the duck legs for a perfectly crisp skin.
