Provençal Roasted Garlic–Braised Breast of Veal with Springtime Stuffing features a veal breast stuffed with a vibrant mixture of wilted Swiss chard and spinach, risotto-style rice, fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley, mint), lemon zest, and egg. The veal is browned, then topped with a purée of roasted garlic, rosemary, and lemon. It's then slowly braised in white wine for 2.5 to 3 hours until very tender, sliced, and served with its concentrated pan juices.
