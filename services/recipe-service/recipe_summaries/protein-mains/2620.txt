A slow-cooker beef and two-bean chili (black beans and chickpeas) that starts by browning lean ground beef with aromatics (onion, bell peppers, garlic) and tomato paste. All ingredients, including diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and a robust blend of chili spices (cumin, chili powder, paprika), are then transferred to a slow cooker. It simmers for 5 hours on high or 8-10 hours on low, yielding 8 servings. The chili is topped with a cilantro-cumin sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese, red onion, and optional crushed tortilla chips.
