This recipe is for Paleo Granola with Coconut and Almonds. It combines unsweetened coconut flakes, various seeds (almonds, pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, optional chia), and spices, all coated in a warm mixture of honey, olive oil, and vanilla. The granola is baked at 300Â°F for about 25 minutes until golden and crisp, and can be stored for up to a week.
