This recipe features **Perciatelli with Roasted Tomato and Almond Pesto**. Plum tomatoes and garlic are roasted until tender, while almonds are toasted. A vibrant pesto is then made by blending roasted garlic, two-thirds of the roasted tomatoes, toasted almonds, olive oil, and crushed red pepper. The cooked pasta is tossed with the pesto, the remaining chopped roasted tomatoes, and some pasta cooking liquid, then garnished with leftover almonds and fresh oregano. It's served with Parmesan cheese on the side.
