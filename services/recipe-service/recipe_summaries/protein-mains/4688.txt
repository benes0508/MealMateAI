This recipe details a vibrant Chicken and Green Papaya Salad. It involves marinating and grilling skinless boneless chicken breasts with soy sauce, sugar, and five-spice, then shredding them. A dressing of lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and garlic is whisked and combined with the shredded chicken and a mix of julienned green papaya, cucumber, daikon, carrot, scallions, and Fresno chile. The salad is tossed and served, optionally on banana blossom petals and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Both chicken seasoning and cooking can be done a day in advance.
