This recipe creates an "Inside-Out Grilled Cheese" sandwich using grilled Halloumi cheese as the "bread." It features two main components: slowly caramelized onions and a sweet and savory fig chutney (made with figs, orange, honey, and hazelnuts). The Halloumi slices are grilled until browned, then layered with fresh arugula, caramelized onions, and fig chutney to form the sandwich.
