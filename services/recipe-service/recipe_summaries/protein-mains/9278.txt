This recipe is for a traditional French Country Pâté (Pâté de Campagne). It involves mixing ground pork and chopped bacon with sautéed onion, garlic, spices, eggs, cream, and reduced cognac. Ham strips are layered within the mixture, which is then pressed into a bacon-lined loaf pan. The pâté is baked in a water bath until cooked through, then pressed and chilled overnight before being sliced and served, typically with coarse sea salt, cornichons, and Dijon mustard.
