This recipe features a burger with a homemade roasted tomatillo salsa verde and a sunny-side up egg, served on toasted sesame seed buns. The salsa is made by broiling tomatillos, onion, and jalape√±os until charred, then blending them with cilantro. The beef patties are smashed and cooked in a hot cast-iron skillet until deeply charred, then assembled with the egg and vibrant salsa.
