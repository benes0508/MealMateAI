Shrimp Un-Fried Rice is a lighter take on classic fried rice, combining cooked shrimp, brown rice, scrambled eggs, red bell pepper, and edamame. The preparation involves quickly cooking the eggs, then stir-frying the vegetables and shrimp before incorporating them with the rice, soy sauce, and sesame seeds, finishing with scallions.
