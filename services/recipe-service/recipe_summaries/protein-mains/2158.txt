This Monte Cristo recipe describes a "French toast" style sandwich. It features egg bread filled with smoked turkey, smoked ham, aged white cheddar cheese, and mustard greens, accented with Dijon mustard. The assembled sandwich is dipped in an egg and mustard mixture, then pan-fried in butter until golden brown and the cheese is melted.
