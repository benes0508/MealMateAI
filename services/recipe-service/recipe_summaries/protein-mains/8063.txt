This Cassoulet recipe describes a rich, slow-cooked French stew featuring a medley of meats and beans. It involves first cooking navy beans with slab bacon and garlic sausage, reserving the concentrated cooking liquid. Separately, pork loin and lamb are seared, then braised with leeks, carrots, parsnips, and tomatoes in a wine and broth base, along with duck confit. Finally, the dish is assembled in layers with the beans, meats, and duck, topped with a breadcrumb-parsley crust, and baked uncovered until a deep golden crust forms.
