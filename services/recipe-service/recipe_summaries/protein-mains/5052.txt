This recipe features baked portobello mushrooms stuffed with a savory mixture of cannellini beans, chopped prosciutto, wilted spinach, shallots, garlic, and rosemary. The mushroom caps are first pre-baked until tender, then filled, topped with a panko and Parmesan crust, and baked again until golden. It's a hearty and flavorful dish, suitable as a main course.
