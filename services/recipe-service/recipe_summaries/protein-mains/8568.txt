This recipe details a "Smoke-Baked Barbecue Chile Pie." It features a deep-dish pie crust layered with fire-roasted chile peppers, cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese, and an egg mixture with sautéed onions. The pie is unique in that it's smoke-baked on a grill or smoker using wood chips (hickory or maple) at 350°F for 40-45 minutes until set and infused with a smoky flavor, then finished with crispy bacon.
