Almond Olive-Oil Tuiles are thin, crisp cookies flavored with almond extract, lemon zest, and a subtle hint of olive oil. Made from a simple batter of sugar, egg white, and starch, they are baked until pale golden, then immediately shaped by draping over a rolling pin to achieve their characteristic curl. Sliced almonds are sprinkled on top for added texture.
