This recipe for Garlic-Curry Chicken Thighs features bone-in, skin-on chicken marinated overnight (or at least 3 hours) in a flavorful blend of garlic, curry powder, olive oil, and Greek yogurt. The chicken is then roasted at 425Â°F for about 35 minutes until browned and cooked through. It's served with a quick lemon-yogurt sauce made with reserved pan juices.
