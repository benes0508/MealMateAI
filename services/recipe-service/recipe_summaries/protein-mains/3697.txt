This recipe details how to make **Breakfast Hobo Packs with Polenta, Prosciutto, and Cherry Tomatoes**, cooked directly on campfire coals or a grill. Individual foil and parchment packs are filled with pre-cooked polenta, cherry tomatoes, and prosciutto tossed with oil and seasonings. These are cooked until steaming hot, then opened to add an egg before being resealed and cooked again until the egg whites are set. Serve immediately, optionally with Parmesan and basil. The packs can be assembled up to 2 days ahead or frozen for a month.
