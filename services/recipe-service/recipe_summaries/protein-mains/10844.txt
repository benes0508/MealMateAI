This recipe prepares **Cumin-Crusted Monster Pork Chops** by rubbing thick pork rib chops with olive oil, salt, pepper, and cracked cumin seeds, then grilling them. The chops are seared over high heat until browned, then moved to a cooler part of the grill to cook indirectly until they reach 145Â°F. They are served with a **Peach Chipotle Salsa** made from diced peaches, red onion, minced chipotle chiles in adobo, lime juice, cilantro, salt, and pepper, offering a balance of sweet, smoky, and spicy flavors.
