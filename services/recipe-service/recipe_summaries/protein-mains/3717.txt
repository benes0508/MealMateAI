This recipe is for Habanero-Marinated Pork Chops served with a Mustard Greens Slaw. Pork chops are marinated in a flavorful blend of habanero, lemongrass, garlic, orange juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar, then grilled until charred. A vibrant slaw is prepared by grilling jicama and tossing it with fresh mustard greens, basil, olive oil, and vinegar. The dish is served with the grilled pork chops, slaw, and a drizzle of the reserved marinade.
