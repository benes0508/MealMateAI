This recipe details how to prepare "Pork Chops with Mustard Sauce." Pork chops are first browned in a skillet, then baked until cooked through. Concurrently, a savory sauce is made in the same skillet by saut√©ing shallots, then simmering with chicken broth, Dijon mustard, heavy cream, and lemon juice until slightly thickened. The sauce is served with the rested pork chops.
