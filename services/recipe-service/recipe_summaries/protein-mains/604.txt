This recipe for "Perfect Pesto Pasta" creates a classic pesto sauce from toasted pine nuts, garlic, grated Parmesan, basil, and olive oil. The pesto is then tossed with al dente long pasta, butter, and a bit of reserved pasta water until glossy and well-coated, finished with shaved Parmesan. Pesto can be made a day ahead.
