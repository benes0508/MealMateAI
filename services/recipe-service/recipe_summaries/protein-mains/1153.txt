Grilled bone-in pork chops are coated in a sweet and tangy glaze made from pineapple juice, honey, rice vinegar, Dijon mustard, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and turmeric. The chops are grilled over direct heat until browned, then basted with the glaze and finished over indirect heat until cooked through. Serve sliced with reserved glaze.
