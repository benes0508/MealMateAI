This recipe is for a slow-baked lamb dish featuring boneless lamb shoulder braised with a puree of onions, garlic, cilantro, and preserved lemons, seasoned with cumin. The lamb cooks uncovered in the oven for 4-4.5 hours until very tender, then is served garnished with fresh cilantro. It can be prepared up to two days in advance.
