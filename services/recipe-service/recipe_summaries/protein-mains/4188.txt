This recipe is for **Buttermilk Fried Chicken Fingers**. Chicken thigh strips are marinated for 24 hours in a buttermilk, milk, onion, jalapeÃ±o, salt, and Tabasco mixture. They are then dredged in a seasoned flour blend (garlic, onion powder, thyme, sage, paprika, cayenne, salt, pepper) and deep-fried until golden and cooked through. Serve with ranch dressing.
