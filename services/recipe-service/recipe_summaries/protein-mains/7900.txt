This Quick Chicken Paella with Sugar Snap Peas features browned chicken thighs and smoked Spanish chorizo cooked with long-grain rice, saffron, smoked paprika, roasted red peppers, and sugar snap peas. The dish is prepared in an oven-proof skillet by browning the meats, saut√©ing aromatics, then simmering the rice with wine, broth, and tomatoes, before baking in the oven until the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through, with sugar snap peas added towards the end.
