This one-dish recipe features chicken quarters seasoned with garlic, soy sauce, and Aleppo pepper, then roasted alongside tomatoes, olives, garlic cloves, and thyme. The dish is baked until the chicken is deeply browned and cooked through, and served with toasted baguette to soak up the flavorful pan juices.
