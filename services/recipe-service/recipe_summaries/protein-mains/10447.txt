This recipe details how to prepare a **Brined and Barbecued Turkey**. A 14-16 pound turkey is first brined for 12 hours in a flavorful solution of salt, sugar, and various aromatics (carrots, onions, celery, leeks, herbs, and spices) kept in a cooler. After brining and drying, the turkey is trussed and barbecued in a roasting pan on a gas or charcoal grill at 450°F for about 1.5 hours, basted frequently, until the thigh reaches 170°F. The turkey then rests before carving.
