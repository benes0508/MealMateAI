Yaka Mein is a savory, hearty noodle soup featuring spaghetti in a rich beef broth, distinctively flavored with Cajun seasoning and soy sauce for a unique fusion profile. It's generously topped with a mix of finely chopped cooked meats (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, turtle), halved hard-boiled eggs, and fresh green onions, assembled into individual bowls.
