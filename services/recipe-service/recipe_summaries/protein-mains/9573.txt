This recipe for Five Spice Pork Rillettes features seasoned pork shoulder and fatback slow-braised for three hours with sherry and aromatics until very tender. The cooked meat is shredded and mashed with a reduction of its cooking liquid, plus cooked carrots and scallions. The mixture is then pressed into a terrine, topped with reserved fat, and chilled for at least 8 hours before being served at room temperature with baguette or crackers.
