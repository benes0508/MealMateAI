This recipe for Shrimp Pad Thai serves four, featuring stir-fried rice noodles, succulent shrimp, and scrambled eggs. A key element is the homemade sauce, a balance of sweet, sour, and savory from tamarind paste, palm sugar, fish sauce, and salt. The process involves soaking the rice noodles, quickly stir-frying shrimp and eggs separately, then stir-frying aromatics before adding the noodles and gradually incorporating the sauce. Finally, the shrimp, eggs, fresh bean sprouts, scallions, and peanuts are added, and the dish is served with lime wedges and optional condiments for personalized seasoning.
