Garden Chicken Alfredo features grilled chicken and an assortment of vegetables (zucchini, squash, bell pepper, portobello mushrooms) combined with whole grain fettuccine. The dish is tossed in a lightened Alfredo-style sauce made with fat-free half-and-half, low-sodium chicken broth, Parmesan, and nonfat Greek yogurt, thickened with cornstarch, and includes artichoke hearts and fresh parsley.
