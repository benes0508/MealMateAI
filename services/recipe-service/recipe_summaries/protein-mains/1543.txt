Mueller's Classic Lasagna is a traditional baked dish featuring layers of ground beef in a savory tomato sauce (with onion, parsley, garlic, oregano, salt, sugar, pepper), lasagna noodles, and a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses. The beef and onion are browned and simmered with the sauce, then layered with cooked noodles and cheeses before being baked at 350Â°F for 40-50 minutes.
