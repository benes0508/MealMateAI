This recipe features **roasted chicken** (whole or parts) seasoned with salt and pepper, first pan-seared to crisp the skin, then oven-roasted. It's cooked with **lemon slices** and **ramps** (or scallions). A flavorful pan sauce is made separately in a skillet by saut√©ing **garlic, shallots, green olives, and thyme**, deglazing with **dry white wine**, and incorporating the reserved chicken pan juices until thickened. The dish is garnished with fresh parsley.
