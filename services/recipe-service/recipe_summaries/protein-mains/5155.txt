This recipe is for Tarte Tatin, a classic French apple tart. It involves creating a caramel sauce with sugar, cider vinegar, vanilla, and butter in an ovenproof skillet. Quartered apples are then arranged over the caramel, topped with a sheet of puff pastry, and sprinkled with sugar. The tart is baked until the pastry is golden and crisp, then inverted to serve. Recommended apple varieties include Braeburn, Cortland, or Golden Delicious.
