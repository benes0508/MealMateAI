Bouillabaisse is a classic Proven√ßal fish stew featuring a rich, saffron-infused broth made with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and fennel. It incorporates a variety of seafood, including lobster, white fish fillets, cockles, mussels, and shrimp, gently simmered with potatoes until tender. The dish is traditionally served hot over garlic-rubbed croutons, topped with rouille.
