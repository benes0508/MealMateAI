This Sambal Short Rib Stir-Fry features thinly sliced boneless beef short ribs, stir-fried with onions, shiitake mushrooms, scallions, ginger, garlic, radishes, and snow peas. The dish gets its distinct spicy and savory flavor from sambal oelek and mirin, simmered in a light chicken broth until glossy. It's typically served over short grain rice, garnished with fresh basil.
