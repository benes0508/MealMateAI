This recipe details how to make Butternut Squash Lasagna Rolls. It involves preparing a smooth butternut squash sauce with saut√©ed shallots and garlic, and a separate filling made from spinach, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, and an egg. Cooked lasagna noodles are spread with the spinach-ricotta mixture, rolled, and placed seam-down in a baking dish over a layer of the butternut squash sauce. The rolls are then topped with more sauce and mozzarella cheese before being baked until heated through.
