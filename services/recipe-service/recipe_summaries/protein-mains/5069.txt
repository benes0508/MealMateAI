Moors and Christians (Moros y Cristianos) is a traditional Cuban rice and black bean dish. It involves simmering black beans with aromatics (onion, bell pepper, optional ham hock) until tender, reserving the cooking liquid. Long-grain rice is then cooked with the prepared beans, saut√©ed bacon, onion, green pepper, and spices like cumin, oregano, and bay leaf, all brought together with the reserved bean liquid, vinegar, and sherry for a flavorful, fluffy rice and bean meal.
