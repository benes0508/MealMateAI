This recipe for "Spring Lamb in Herbs" features a bone-in leg of lamb slow-roasted for 4-4.5 hours with an aromatic paste made from fresh herbs (cilantro, dill, tarragon, scallions), toasted coriander and fennel seeds, preserved lemons, and garlic. The lamb is cooked until exceptionally tender, then shredded and served alongside boiled baby Yukon gold potatoes, tossed in the rich pan juices, and garnished with fresh herbs, olive oil, lemon juice, and sea salt.
