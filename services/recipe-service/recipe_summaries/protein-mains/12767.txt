This recipe details how to make savory Fried Sauerkraut Cakes with Kielbasa. Sauerkraut is rinsed, dried, and mixed with eggs, flour, scallions, salt, and pepper to form patties. These are fried until golden, then kept warm in the oven. Kielbasa slices are browned in the same pan. The dish is served with the fried cakes topped with the browned kielbasa, optionally with warm applesauce.
