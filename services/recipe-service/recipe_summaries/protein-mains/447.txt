Pansit Palabok is a Filipino rice noodle dish featuring a rich, flavorful shrimp sauce. It's prepared by making a roux-based sauce using a homemade shrimp stock (derived from shrimp shells, annatto seeds, and crab paste), then serving it over cooked rice noodles. The dish is generously topped with cooked shrimp and squid, crushed pork rinds, smoked tofu, and tinapa (smoked fish flakes), garnished with lemon wedges.
