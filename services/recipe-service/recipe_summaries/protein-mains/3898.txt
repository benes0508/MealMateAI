Adobo Chicken in Parchment is a flavorful dish featuring chicken legs steamed in individual parchment parcels with a rich, aromatic adobo sauce. The adobo is made from rehydrated guajillo and de Ã¡rbol chiles, garlic, and a blend of spices including cumin, oregano, anise, cloves, and cinnamon. The chicken is coated in this sauce, wrapped, and then steamed for 1.75 to 2 hours until incredibly tender and falling off the bone.
