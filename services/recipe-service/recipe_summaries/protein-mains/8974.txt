These savory Asparagus and Mushroom Tarts feature a flaky puff pastry base topped with a rich filling of sautéed shiitake mushrooms, fresh asparagus, Gruyère cheese, crème fraîche, thyme, and lemon peel. The tarts are baked at 400°F until golden and the filling is cooked through, approximately 22 minutes.
