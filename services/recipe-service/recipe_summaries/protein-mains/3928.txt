This Granola recipe combines rolled oats with wheat germ, flax seeds, sesame seeds, and chopped blanched almonds. It's bound and sweetened with canola oil, honey, and molasses, then spiced with cinnamon and a touch of black pepper. The mixture is baked at 300Â°F for 30-35 minutes, stirred periodically, until golden brown and crunchy. Dried fruit is added after baking, and the granola can be stored for up to two weeks.
