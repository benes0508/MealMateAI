This recipe details how to prepare a "Grilled Turkey Under a Brick," a spatchcocked (butterflied) turkey dry-brined with a spice rub, then grilled to perfection. The unique technique involves placing foil-wrapped bricks or a cinder block on top of the turkey during the initial grilling phase (skin-side down) to achieve incredibly crispy skin and even cooking. The turkey is then flipped and cooked through until it reaches 160Â°F, followed by a resting period before carving.
