**Panettone Dressing Squares** is a savory baked dressing combining finely chopped and fried shallots/onions, apples, celery, sage, and pancetta/bacon. This is mixed with crumbled chestnuts, lemon zest and juice, and torn panettone to form a fragrant paste. Beaten eggs are then incorporated before baking at 400Â°F for 25-30 minutes until set and browned. It can be served as bite-sized appetizers or larger pieces to accompany roasted meats.
