Mediterranean Bison Sliders feature lean ground bison mixed with basmati rice, toasted almonds, raisins, parsley, and mint, formed into mini meatballs and baked. These are served on small brioche buns, topped with warm marinara sauce, and finished with a fresh yogurt-lemon-mint sauce and a mint leaf garnish.
