Maple Pots de Cr√®me with Almond Praline is a rich, chilled custard dessert. It features a maple-infused cream base, baked until set, and topped with a homemade almond praline. The praline involves caramelizing sugar and corn syrup, pouring it over toasted almonds, and then breaking it into pieces or crumbs. The custards are made by whisking egg yolks, maple sugar, brown sugar, maple extract, and salt with heavy cream, then baking them in a water bath until just set, followed by chilling.
