This recipe features grilled whole sea bream (or similar fish) coated in a sweet and spicy chile glaze. The glaze is made by toasting and crumbling guajillo and ancho chiles, then simmering them with caramelized sugar, garlic, agave nectar, orange, grapefruit, and lime juices, and fish sauce. The fish is scored, seasoned, placed in a grilling basket, and grilled until cooked through, brushed with the flavorful chile glaze during the process, and garnished with fresh cilantro.
