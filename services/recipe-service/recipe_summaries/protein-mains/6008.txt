Bún Bò Hue is a traditional Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup featuring a rich, complex broth. It's made by simmering blanched beef (oxtail, shank, marrowbones, brisket) and pork bones with abundant lemongrass. A key element is a flavorful, vibrant red chili oil (sate) created by sautéing red pepper flakes, annatto seeds, shallots, garlic, and pungent shrimp paste. The soup is served with round rice noodles, thinly sliced beef brisket, and a variety of fresh garnishes including Thai basil, perilla leaves, cabbage, lemon, lime, and onion.
