This recipe prepares "Baked Chicken and Bacon-Wrapped Lady Apples." Chicken thighs are browned and baked alongside partially cooked, bacon-wrapped lady apples. A pan sauce, made by reducing apple cider, cider vinegar, and marjoram, then finished with butter, is poured over the chicken and apples before they are baked together until tender.
