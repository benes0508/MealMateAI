This recipe details a festive Sage Butter-Roasted Turkey, ideal for gatherings. A large turkey is pre-seasoned overnight with a sage-salt rub, then roasted with a savory sage-butter baste and apple cider. The accompanying rich gravy is made from the pan drippings, thickened with flour, and enhanced with apple cider, stock, and a touch of apple brandy (Calvados).
