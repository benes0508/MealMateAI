This Japanese-style fried rice (Chahan) features short-grain white rice and scrambled eggs, complemented by shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, corn, and edamame. A distinct savory-sweet, thickened sauce made with chicken stock, Japanese soy sauce, sake, and sugar is prepared separately and poured over molded rice for serving, garnished with scallions.
