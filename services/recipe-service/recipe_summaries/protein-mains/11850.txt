This recipe details how to prepare Salmon Gravlax Tartare served on homemade Crisp Potato Slices. Diced fresh salmon is cured overnight (or 6+ hours) with a mixture of gravlax ingredients (juniper berries, dill, sugar, salt), olive oil, chives, orange zest, and pepper. Concurrently, thin potato slices are brushed with oil, seasoned, and baked until crisp. The cured salmon tartare is then served atop these crisp potato slices (or cucumber slices) and garnished with fresh dill.
