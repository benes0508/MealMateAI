This Shrimp Fried Rice recipe features shrimp, cold cooked white rice, eggs, edamame, and peas, flavored with scallions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil. The cooking process involves quickly saut√©ing the shrimp, then stir-frying aromatics with the rice until crisp, incorporating scrambled eggs, and finally tossing in the vegetables, sauces, and cooked shrimp until heated through.
