Casônsèi from Val Camonica are homemade Italian pasta dumplings (similar to ravioli) filled with a savory mixture of mashed potatoes, sautéed Swiss chard, Italian sausage, leeks, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. The pasta dough is made from flour, eggs, and olive oil. The dumplings are shaped into a horseshoe, boiled until al dente, and served immediately with melted butter and extra grated Parmesan.
