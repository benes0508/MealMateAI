This recipe transforms store-bought kettle-cooked potato chips into a gourmet snack. Chips are briefly baked until crisp, then tossed while warm with an aromatic spice blend of onion and garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and salt, along with olive oil, fresh dill, lemon zest, and black pepper for maximum flavor absorption.
