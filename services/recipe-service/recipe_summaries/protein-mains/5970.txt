This recipe details how to prepare Prosciutto-Stuffed Chicken with Mushroom Sauce. Boneless chicken breasts are pounded thin, filled with prosciutto, provolone, and fresh basil, then rolled and tied. The chicken roulades are seared until golden, then baked to perfection. A savory sauce is made in the same pan by saut√©ing mixed mushrooms, deglazing with chicken broth and red wine vinegar, and finishing with fresh herbs. The cooked chicken is sliced and served with the mushroom sauce.
