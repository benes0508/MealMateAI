This recipe details how to make a **Fromage Blanc Soufflé**. It involves creaming butter with lemon zest and cornstarch, then incorporating egg yolks and fromage blanc. Separately, egg whites are whipped with sugar until stiff, then gently folded into the fromage blanc mixture. The soufflé is baked at 375°F (190°C) until golden brown and jiggly in the center.
