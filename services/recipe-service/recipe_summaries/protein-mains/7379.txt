Grilled Stuffed Peppers feature green bell peppers filled with a seasoned mixture of ground venison/breakfast sausage, ground beef, cooked rice, garlic, parsley, and an egg, flavored with wine, cumin, cayenne, and a preferred spice blend (e.g., kebab or Cajun). The prepared peppers are grilled: first pepper-side down until charred and soft (10-12 minutes), then meat-side down until cooked through (10 minutes). They can be served hot, cold, or sliced for sandwiches.
