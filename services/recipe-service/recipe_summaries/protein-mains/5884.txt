This recipe details how to make a smooth, flavorful Roasted Carrot Soup. Carrots are roasted with butter until tender, then blended with vegetable broth. The soup is served hot, garnished with a dollop of low-fat plain Greek yogurt and a homemade Dukkah spice blend, made from toasted and coarsely ground pistachios, sesame, coriander, cumin, fennel seeds, and black peppercorns.
