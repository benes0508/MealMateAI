This recipe features **Scottish Salmon** with a fragrant **shallot-truffle honey glaze**, served alongside a **creamy lump crab and green apple risotto**, and brightened with a homemade **quince jam**. The salmon is pan-cooked and then broiled with the savory-sweet glaze, while the risotto combines pre-cooked arborio rice with fresh crab and diced apple. The dish is assembled by plating the risotto, topping with salmon, and drizzling with the tangy quince jam.
