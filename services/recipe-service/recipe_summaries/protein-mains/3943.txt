This recipe for "The Ultimate Bolognese Sauce" features a rich blend of ground beef, pork shoulder, and finely chopped chicken livers, slow-cooked with tomatoes, red wine, and milk. Aromatic vegetables like onion, garlic, thyme, and Mama Lil's peppers are complemented by toasted and ground spices (bay leaves, cloves, fennel, red pepper flakes, black peppercorns). The sauce is baked in the oven for 6 hours, then pureed until smooth, and served with pappardelle.
