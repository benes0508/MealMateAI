This recipe is for a **Plum-Glazed Turkey**, ideal for special occasions. It involves preparing a homemade giblet broth and chopping giblets a day in advance. The turkey is stuffed with Cranberry Fennel Stuffing, seasoned, and roasted in stages, initially covered, then uncovered and basted. Towards the end of roasting, it's brushed with a plum glaze for flavor and color. The cooked turkey is rested, carved, and garnished with grapes and fresh sage before serving.
