This recipe is for **Dr. BBQ's Lobster with Chili-Lime Butter**. It involves grilling halved Maine lobsters (tails and claws) seasoned with a BBQ rub, then basting them with a **chili-lime butter** made from melted butter, lime juice, chili powder, salt, and pepper. The lobster is grilled for about 10-14 minutes total, until just done, with the remaining butter served for dipping.
