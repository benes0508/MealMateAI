This Confit Chicken Thigh and Andouille Sausage Cassoulet is a hearty, multi-stage dish. It features **chicken thighs slow-cooked in oil (confit)** until tender, a process that can be done ahead. A rich base is then created from **white beans, tomatoes, and aromatics**, enhanced with the flavorful confit oil and juices. The confited chicken, smoked **andouille sausage**, and shallots are nestled into the bean mixture and **baked for hours** until the chicken skin is crisp and the cassoulet is deeply browned, finished with a golden **sourdough breadcrumb** topping.
