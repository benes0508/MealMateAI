This recipe details how to prepare a **Pastrami-Style Grilled Turkey Breast**. A bone-in, skin-on turkey breast is generously rubbed with a coarse blend of **coriander, black peppercorns, fennel, and Sichuan peppercorns**, along with oil and salt. After an optional marination, it's primarily cooked on a charcoal grill using indirect heat at 350°F (with optional smoking chips) until it reaches an internal temperature of 150°F. An oven-roasting method is also provided as an alternative. The cooked turkey is then rested for 30 minutes before carving.
