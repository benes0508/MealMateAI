This recipe details how to make Preserved Lemons using lemons, salt, and optional spices (cinnamon, cloves, coriander, peppercorns, bay leaf). Lemons are quartered, salted, and tightly packed into a sterile jar with more salt and spices, pressing to release juices (supplementing with fresh lemon juice if needed). The jar is then sealed and ripened in a warm place for 30 days, shaken daily. The preserved lemons can be rinsed and used as needed, keeping for up to a year without refrigeration after opening, and the pickling juice can be reused.
