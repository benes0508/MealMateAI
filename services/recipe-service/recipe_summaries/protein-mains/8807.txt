Brother David's Grilled Chicken & Ribs features chicken and pork ribs seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then grilled at 350Â°F. The meat is seared for 5 minutes per side, then brushed with a sweet tangy barbecue sauce every 5 minutes until cooked through and caramelized (35-40 minutes). Served with extra sauce.
