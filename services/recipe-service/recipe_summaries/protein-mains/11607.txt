This recipe details how to prepare a **Grilled Leg of Lamb with Curly Endive and Romaine**. A butterflied leg of lamb is marinated for 4-6 hours in a mixture of red wine, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mint, garlic, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper. It's then grilled to medium-rare (125Â°F), basting with the reserved marinade. Curly endive and romaine hearts are brushed with the remaining marinade, seasoned, and grilled until wilted.
