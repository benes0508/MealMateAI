This recipe is for **Garlic-Chile Grilled Turkey Thighs**, using boneless, skinless turkey thighs marinated for at least 2 hours in a paste made from garlic, salt, chili powder, cumin, and olive oil. The turkey is then grilled directly over medium-hot heat (charcoal or gas) for 15-25 minutes until it reaches 170Â°F, and rested before slicing. The recipe also notes saving the turkey skin and bones for future use.
