This recipe features grilled corn on the cob, prepared by grilling the ears in their inner husks until tender and charred. The cooked corn is then brushed with a creamy sauce made from crema (or sour cream/creme fraiche), lime juice, chile powder (chipotle or ancho), and salt. It's finished with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and served alongside grilled lime quarters.
