This recipe details how to make **Grilled Chicken with Board Dressing**. Chicken halves are grilled over indirect heat until cooked through, then basted with a vibrant dressing made from toasted dried chile (or flakes), cilantro, oregano, lime zest, and olive oil. The unique "board dressing" technique involves pouring the remaining dressing onto a carving board, placing the hot grilled chicken directly on it to rest and absorb the flavors before serving.
