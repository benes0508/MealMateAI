"Beer-Can Cabbage Sandwiches" features a large purple cabbage cored and cooked upright on a beer can on the grill, basted with barbecue sauce until tender and caramelized. This barbecued cabbage, along with grilled white onions, is served on toasted kaiser rolls with cheddar cheese and a tangy homemade coleslaw made from reserved cabbage, carrots, and red onion. Pickled jalape√±os are an optional garnish.
