A unique take on chicken soup, featuring caramelized ginger as its aromatic base. Sugar is caramelized before adding thinly sliced ginger, garlic, and scallions. Chicken thighs are then simmered in water with a cilantro bundle and fresno chile. The shredded chicken is returned to the soup, finished with soy sauce, and served with fresh cilantro and scallions for a savory, subtly sweet, and aromatic flavor profile with a hint of spice.
