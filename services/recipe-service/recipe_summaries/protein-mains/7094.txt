Reina Pepiada Arepas are Venezuelan cornmeal patties (arepas) filled with a creamy chicken and avocado salad. The filling is made by simmering and shredding chicken, then mixing it with mashed avocado, mayonnaise, vinegar, and a blend of fresh herbs (cilantro, parsley), jalape√±o, garlic, red bell pepper, red onion, and scallion. The arepas are prepared from Venezuelan cornmeal dough, shaped into disks, pan-fried until golden, and then baked until a firm crust forms. Finally, the warm arepas are split open and generously filled with the savory chicken-avocado mixture.
