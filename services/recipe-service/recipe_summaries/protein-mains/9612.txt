This recipe adapts Huevos Rancheros into individual tortilla cups, perfect for breakfast or brunch. Corn tortillas are pressed into oiled custard cups, filled with a seasoned mashed bean mixture, topped with an egg and Monterey Jack cheese, then baked until the eggs are set. The dish is finished with a fresh pico de gallo and chipotle hot sauce topping.
