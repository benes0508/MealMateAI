This recipe features a butterflied turkey generously stuffed under the skin with a savory mixture of sweet Italian sausage, diced fennel, leeks, shallots, garlic, ricotta, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, and aromatic herbs like sage and rosemary. The turkey is seasoned with a fennel and rosemary infused olive oil. It offers two distinct cooking methods: oven roasting for a classic approach, or indirect grilling on a barbecue for a smoky flavor. Both methods aim for a juicy turkey, cooked to perfection (160-165Â°F), and include resting time. The dish is accompanied by a specific gravy depending on the chosen cooking method.
