This recipe details how to prepare an Egg Roulade stuffed with a savory filling. An egg and cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano, Gruyère) base is baked into a thin layer. This is then filled with a mixture of cooked turkey sausage, sautéed shiitake and cremini mushrooms, and spinach (partially blended for texture), topped with more Gruyère, baked until the cheese melts, then carefully rolled up and sliced.
