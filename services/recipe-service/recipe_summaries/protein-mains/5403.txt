This recipe details how to make **Tamarind "Teriyaki" Chicken Skewers**. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pan-fried with a tangy-sweet sauce made from tamarind (or pomegranate molasses), dark brown sugar, rice vinegar, molasses, garlic, and thickened with cornstarch. Once cooked, the chicken is threaded onto bamboo skewers, drizzled with the remaining sauce, and garnished with toasted sesame seeds and green onions.
