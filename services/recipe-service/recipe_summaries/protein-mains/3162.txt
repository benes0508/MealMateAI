This recipe details poaching white fish fillets (such as cod, hake, or sea bass) in a flavorful chili-tomato sauce base, enriched with saut√©ed onion, fennel, and cherry tomatoes. Baby spinach and olives are stirred in just before serving, and the dish is finished with a fresh topping of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest.
