Parsnip-Wrapped Devils on Horseback is a unique appetizer featuring dates stuffed with blue cheese and smoked almonds. These are wrapped in thinly sliced parsnip ribbons, pre-marinated in a savory soy sauce and smoked paprika mixture. The bundles are then baked until the parsnip is browned and slightly crisped. It's designed to be served immediately but can be assembled ahead of time.
