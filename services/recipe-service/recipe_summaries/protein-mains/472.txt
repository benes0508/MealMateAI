Coconut Creamed Greens is a flavorful and naturally plant-based side dish. Hardy greens like kale and chard are simmered in a rich, creamy coconut milk sauce infused with aromatic ginger, garlic, onion, chile, and a blend of mustard seeds, coriander, and turmeric. It's finished with a garnish of toasted coconut flakes and fresh cilantro.
