This is a hearty Toasted Spelt Soup with Escarole and White Beans. It features spelt toasted with pancetta, then simmered with a finely chopped mirepoix (onion, fennel, carrot, celery, garlic), tomato paste, and red pepper flakes in chicken broth. After simmering for 60-70 minutes until the spelt is tender, escarole and cannellini beans are stirred in to wilt and warm through. The soup is served with a drizzle of olive oil and shaved Parmesan and can be made up to two days ahead.
