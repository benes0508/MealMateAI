This Sheet-Pan Spaghetti Squash Puttanesca features spaghetti squash roasted on a sheet pan until tender. A savory, briny sauce made with tomatoes, olives, capers, garlic, optional anchovy, and shiitake mushrooms is cooked alongside on the same pan. The dish is finished with toasted pine nuts, fresh basil and parsley, and a dollop of ricotta, offering a complete and flavorful meal.
