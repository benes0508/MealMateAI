Tim Love's Baby Back Ribs features pork baby back ribs seasoned with a dry rub of guajillo chile powder, cumin, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, and sugar. The recipe emphasizes removing the membrane, then cooking the ribs low and slow using indirect heat (smoker or grill with hardwood chips like pecan) at 225Â°F for 3-4 hours until tender.
