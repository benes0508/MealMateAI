This recipe is for **Bo Ssäm**, a large-format Korean-American dish featuring a whole 8-10 lb bone-in Boston pork butt. The pork is first dry-cured with salt and sugar overnight, then slow-roasted for 6 hours until incredibly tender. Before serving, a brown sugar and salt rub is applied, and the pork is briefly roasted at high heat to create a crisp, sweet crust. It's traditionally served whole and hot, surrounded by accompaniments like shucked oysters, kimchi, ginger scallion sauce, ssäm sauce, short grain rice, and bibb lettuce leaves for wrapping.
