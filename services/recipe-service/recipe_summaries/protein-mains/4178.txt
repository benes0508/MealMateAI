This "Beef and Squash Chili" is a hearty, flavorful dish featuring tender beef chuck roast and acorn squash simmered in a rich, smoky sauce made from rehydrated ancho and pasilla chiles, enhanced with lager, cumin, and oregano. The recipe involves browning beef, saut√©ing aromatics, and then slow-simmering until the meat and squash are tender. It's garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds, sour cream, avocado, and red onion, and can be prepared up to 3 days in advance or frozen.
