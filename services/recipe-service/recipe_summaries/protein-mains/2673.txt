This Best-of-Both-Worlds Lobster Roll features steamed lobster meat, gently warmed in butter, then tossed with a refreshing mayonnaise-based dressing (celery, lemon zest, lemon juice, chives). It's served in a buttered, toasted New England-style split-top hot dog bun, lined with lettuce. Key components can be prepped a day in advance.
