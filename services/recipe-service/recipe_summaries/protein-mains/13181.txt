This recipe is for **Filet Mignon with Green Peppercorn Cream Sauce**. It involves pan-searing filet mignon steaks seasoned with salt and pepper. A sauce is then made in the same skillet by saut√©ing shallots, deglazing with reduced beef stock, and simmering with whipping cream, cognac, and green peppercorns until thickened, then spooned over the cooked steaks.
