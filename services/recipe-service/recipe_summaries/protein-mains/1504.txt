This recipe describes Leche Flan with a citrus twist. It's a classic smooth custard dessert, infused with grapefruit zest and topped with fresh grapefruit segments. A base of caramelized sugar is poured into baking dishes, over which the egg, milk, cream, and zest custard is added. The flan is then gently baked in a water bath until set, and can be prepared a day in advance.
