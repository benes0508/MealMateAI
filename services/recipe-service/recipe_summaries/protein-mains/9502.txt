This recipe details how to prepare an **Extra-Moist Turkey with Pan Gravy**. It involves seasoning and trussing an 11-12 pound turkey with onion and thyme, then roasting it in a covered pan at 400°F (initially covered, then uncovered to brown) until the thigh reaches 170°F (total 1.75-2.25 hours). The turkey is then rested for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, a pan gravy is made by straining the pan juices, skimming the fat, and whisking a roux with flour and reserved fat, then incorporating the pan juices and turkey stock, simmering until thickened.
