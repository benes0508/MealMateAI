This recipe features **Cumin-Crusted Chicken Thighs** paired with a vibrant **Grilled Tomatillo Salsa**. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are coated in oil and a cumin rub, then grilled indirectly until cooked through. The accompanying salsa is made by charring tomatillos and a jalape√±o on the grill, then blending them with lime juice, olive oil, and fresh cilantro. The chicken is rested before serving with the chunky salsa.
