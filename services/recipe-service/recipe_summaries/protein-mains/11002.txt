This recipe prepares Spaghetti Carbonara featuring pork belly, prepared through a multi-step process: brining with salt and coriander, slow-braising with aromatics and wine, then browning and incorporating its flavorful cooking liquid. The dish combines spaghetti and fresh peas with a rich sauce of eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, and fresh parsley.
