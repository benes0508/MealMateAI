This recipe is for **Texas-Style Smoked Brisket**, featuring a whole 10-12 pound beef brisket seasoned with salt and pepper. It's cooked low and slow on a gas grill (or smoker) at 225-250°F using hickory wood chips for deep smoky flavor. The process involves precise temperature management and consistent smoke for 10-12 hours until the meat reaches 195-205°F and is very tender. An optional "cheat" method allows finishing the brisket in the oven after initial smoking. The brisket is rested, then sliced against the grain and typically served with sides like coleslaw, potato salad, and pinto beans.
