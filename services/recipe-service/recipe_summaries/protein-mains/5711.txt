This recipe features pan-roasted salmon, cooked skin-side down for crispiness and then finished in the oven. It's served with tender collard greens, saut√©ed with garlic and finished with fresh radishes and sherry vinegar. A refreshing Radish Raita, made from shredded daikon, cucumber, Greek yogurt, fresh mint, and a touch of cayenne, accompanies the dish.
