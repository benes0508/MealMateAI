This recipe for Italian Sausage and Bread Stuffing involves toasting bread cubes, browning sweet Italian sausage, and saut√©ing a mix of onions, celery, and garlic. These are then combined with the bread, along with eggs, heavy cream, turkey stock, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. The stuffing can be used to fill a turkey or baked separately in a dish until hot through and golden and crisp on top.
