This recipe features a Harissa-Crusted Tri-Tip Roast. A homemade harissa paste is made by blending toasted caraway seeds, olive oil, garlic, chili paste, tomato sauce, cumin, and chili powder. The tri-tip beef roast is seasoned, coated with the harissa, then roasted at 400°F until it reaches desired doneness (e.g., 125-130°F for medium-rare), followed by a resting period before slicing and serving.
