This recipe is for **Good Luck Beef and Korean Rice Cake Soup (Tteokguk)**, a traditional Korean soup. It features beef brisket or stew meat browned and simmered with ginger, garlic, and scallions to create a rich broth. Korean radish and Korean rice cakes (tteok) are cooked in the flavorful broth, and the soup is typically garnished with thinly sliced egg crepe, fresh scallion greens, and optional Korean red chile threads.
