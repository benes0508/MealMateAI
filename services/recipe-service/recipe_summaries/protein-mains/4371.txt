This recipe details how to make savory Stuffed Onions with Spiced Lamb and Pomegranate. Whole Spanish onions are boiled, their layers peeled, and then filled with a mixture of ground lamb, rice, chopped onions, anchovies, and aromatic spices like allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The stuffed onions are roasted in a broth-pomegranate molasses-tomato paste sauce until tender, then briefly broiled for a golden finish. They are served garnished with fresh herbs and pomegranate seeds.
