This recipe for "Crazy Nachos" details how to make homemade nachos featuring three main components: a flavorful chipotle taco meat (ground beef, onion, garlic, tomato, various spices), fresh guacamole, and crispy fried tortilla chips. The nachos are assembled by topping the chips with refried beans, the taco meat, and cheddar cheese, then baked until melted. They are finished with scoops of guacamole, sour cream, and pickled jalape√±o slices, served warm with salsa.
