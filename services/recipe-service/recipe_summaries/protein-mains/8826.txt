This recipe details how to make Black-Eyed Pea Fritters with Hot Pepper Sauce. Dried black-eyed peas are soaked, skinned, and then blended with onion, peanuts, thyme, cayenne, vinegar, water, and salt to form a smooth batter, which is then chilled. Bell pepper and cornmeal are added before spooning tablespoons of the batter into hot coconut oil and frying until golden brown. The fritters are drained and kept warm in an oven, served hot with Hot Pepper Sauce.
