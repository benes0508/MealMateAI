Honey-Sriracha Chicken Skewers are grilled chicken thighs seasoned with paprika, garlic, onion, and salt. They are skewered and basted with a sweet and spicy sauce made from rice vinegar, sriracha, honey, and Dijon mustard. The finished skewers are topped with crumbled blue cheese and fresh parsley.
