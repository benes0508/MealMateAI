This recipe details how to make **Arepas**, using arepa flour, salt, water, and oil. The dough is mixed, rested, kneaded, and shaped into 1/2-inch thick patties. These are then pan-fried in a nonstick skillet until golden brown on both sides (covered then uncovered). Arepas are served split and stuffed with desired fillings like shredded chicken, beans, or corn salad, accompanied by lime wedges.
