This recipe details how to make Balsamic Soy-Glazed Chicken Wings. Chicken wingettes are seasoned and roasted at 500Â°F until golden and tender. Concurrently, a savory-sweet glaze is prepared by simmering balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar, then finished with butter. The hot roasted wings are then tossed with the reduced glaze to coat thoroughly.
