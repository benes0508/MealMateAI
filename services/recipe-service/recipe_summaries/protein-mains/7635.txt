This is a vegetarian/vegan dish featuring olive oil-roasted fennel and grape tomatoes, seasoned with fresh oregano, garlic, and a hint of crushed red pepper. The vegetables are first seared in a skillet then oven-roasted until tender, with cannellini beans stirred in at the end. It can be served warm or at room temperature.
