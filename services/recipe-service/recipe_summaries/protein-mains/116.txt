Bibingkang Cassava is a traditional Filipino cake made from grated cassava, egg yolks, coconut milk, macapuno (or shredded coconut), and sweetened condensed milk, baked until set. A simple topping of whisked egg whites and additional condensed milk is then added and baked briefly until solidified. The cake is served cooled, either at room temperature or chilled.
