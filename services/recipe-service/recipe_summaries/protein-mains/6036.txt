This recipe details a Pit-Barbecue Style Goat in Chile Marinade, an oven-baked dish (also suitable for lamb). It involves making a rich, aromatic paste from rehydrated guajillo chiles, ground spices (cumin, cloves, allspice, oregano), fresh thyme, garlic, onion, and cider vinegar. Seasoned goat or lamb is generously slathered with this strained paste and marinated overnight. Finally, the meat is slow-baked for 6-7 hours (4-4.5 hours for lamb) with dried avocado leaves until exceptionally tender.
