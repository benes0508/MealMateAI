**Porchetta-Style Roast Turkey Breast** is a flavorful dish where a butterflied and flattened turkey breast is filled with an aromatic paste of rendered pancetta, garlic, fresh herbs (sage, parsley, chives, rosemary), and lemon zest, along with a spice rub of fennel seeds and red pepper flakes. The turkey is then rolled into a log, tied, slow-roasted, and finished with slices of bacon for a crisp, savory exterior. The method creates a moist, herb-infused, and richly flavored roast.
