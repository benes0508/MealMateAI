This recipe details how to prepare **Grilled Lemon Chicken**. Chicken pieces are marinated for at least 8 hours in a blend of lemon zest, lemon juice, vegetable oil, egg, and seasonings. The chicken is then grilled using a two-zone method (either charcoal or gas), first searing over direct heat until browned, then cooking through over indirect heat until done.
