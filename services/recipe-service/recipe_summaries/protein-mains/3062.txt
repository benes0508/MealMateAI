This recipe details how to prepare a Roast Chicken with Smothered Cabbage, Bacon, and Potatoes. A whole chicken, seasoned with an herb-butter mixture (lemon, garlic, chives, parsley) under its skin, is roasted with potato wedges, bacon, and savoy cabbage tossed with caraway seeds. The dish is cooked in a single pan, starting at a high temperature and finishing at a lower one, with lemon squeezed over the vegetables mid-roast to combine flavors.
