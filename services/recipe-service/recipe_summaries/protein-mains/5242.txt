Fat Rice is an elaborate and richly flavored rice dish blending diverse culinary influences. It features jasmine rice cooked with marinated chicken thighs, cured Spanish chorizo, Chinese/Andouille sausage, prawns, and clams. A base of caramelized bell pepper and onion soffritto, along with a complex array of spices like smoked paprika, curry, turmeric, and gochugaru, creates a savory and subtly spicy profile. The dish culminates in a desired crispy rice bottom and is generously garnished with hard-boiled eggs, olives, and pickled chiles.
