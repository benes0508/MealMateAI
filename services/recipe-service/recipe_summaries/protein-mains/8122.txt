This recipe creates a plant-based meal featuring pan-fried Gardein "chicken" scaloppini served over crispy udon noodle cakes, accompanied by sautéed pea shoots and a savory shiitake mushroom and sake sauce. The udon noodles are cut into rounds and pan-fried until golden, while the Gardein is lightly floured and browned. The sauce is made by sautéing shiitake mushrooms, deglazing with sake, and finishing with a faux chicken stock and vegan butter. The pea shoots are quickly sautéed with garlic. The dish is assembled by layering the noodle cake, pea shoots, Gardein, and sauce, then garnished with microgreens.
