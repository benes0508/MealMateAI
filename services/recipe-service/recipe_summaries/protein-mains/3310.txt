Turkey Pho Dip is an "au jus" style sandwich featuring a homemade pho-flavored turkey broth. The recipe involves simmering a turkey carcass with traditional pho spices to create the rich dipping broth. Leftover turkey is warmed in some of this broth, and a spicy mayonnaise is prepared. Sandwiches are assembled on sturdy rolls with the warmed turkey, spicy mayo, hoisin, and fresh herbs, then served with the warm pho broth on the side for dipping.
