This recipe details how to prepare Parmesan Chicken Cutlets. Chicken cutlets are breaded by dredging in flour, coating with beaten egg, and then pressing into a mix of panko, Parmesan, and mustard powder. The breaded cutlets are then pan-fried in olive oil until golden brown and cooked through, served fresh with lemon. A make-ahead option for freezing the breaded chicken is also provided.
