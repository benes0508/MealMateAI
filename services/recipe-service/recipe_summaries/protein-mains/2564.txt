This recipe details how to make Cauliflower Pizzas with Mozzarella, Kale, and Lemon. It involves preparing a gluten-free crust from processed cauliflower, almond meal, Parmesan, and eggs, which is baked until golden. The pizzas are then topped with a mix of kale, olive oil, garlic, chili, and lemon zest, baked again until the kale is crisp, and finally garnished with torn mozzarella and fresh basil.
