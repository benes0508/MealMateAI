This recipe prepares "Smoked Pork in Pastry," featuring a smoked pork butt roasted until tender, then encased in a rich vegetable and breadcrumb filling (made with mustard greens, cabbage, spinach, and salt pork). This mixture and the pork are then wrapped in a homemade yeast dough, decorated, brushed with egg wash, and baked until golden brown.
