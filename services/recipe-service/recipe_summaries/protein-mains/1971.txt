This Kefi Lamb Gyro recipe features a flavorful blend of ground lamb and pork, seasoned with grilled onion, garlic, coriander, fresh herbs, and Espelette pepper. The meat mixture is baked in a water bath to form a loaf, then chilled for several hours (ideally 24) to develop flavors. Once firm, it's sliced and pan-seared until hot and crispy. The gyro meat is served in warm, grilled pitas with Tzatziki and Greek salad, assembled "taco-style."
