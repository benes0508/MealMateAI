This recipe for Baked Chicken with White Beans and Tomatoes features bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. It involves browning bacon and then the chicken in the rendered fat. Onions are then saut√©ed, followed by stewed tomatoes, rinsed white beans, and the cooked bacon to create a savory sauce. The chicken is finally nestled into this mixture and baked until cooked through.
