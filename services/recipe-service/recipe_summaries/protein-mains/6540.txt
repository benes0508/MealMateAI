This Classic Posole recipe features slow-roasted, shredded pork shoulder in a rich stew with hominy, pinto beans, and diced tomatoes, seasoned with cumin, smoked paprika, and oregano. The pork is roasted for 5-6 hours until very tender, then added to a simmered broth with saut√©ed onions, garlic, and other ingredients. It's served garnished with shredded cheddar, fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and flour tortillas.
