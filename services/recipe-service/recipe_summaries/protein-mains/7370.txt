"Flash-Fried Finger-Lickin' Chicken" is a recipe for crispy fried chicken. Bone-in chicken thighs are first simmered in seasoned chicken broth until tender. They are then double-coated in buttermilk and a spiced whole wheat flour mixture, before being flash-fried in 400Â°F grapeseed oil for 30 seconds to 1 minute until golden brown.
