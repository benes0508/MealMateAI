This recipe for Grilled Indian-Spiced Butter Chicken features chicken marinated for at least 16 hours in a vibrant paste of onion, garlic, ginger, green chile, yogurt, and Indian spices like coriander, turmeric, and cayenne. The chicken is then grilled over indirect heat, periodically basted with homemade clarified butter (ghee), resulting in a tender, flavorful main course.
