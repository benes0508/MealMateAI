This Minestrone recipe is a hearty soup featuring pre-soaked and cooked white beans, pancetta, and a rich medley of vegetables including onion, carrots, celery, garlic, zucchini, green beans, potatoes, cabbage, kale, and tomatoes, all simmered in chicken broth. The preparation involves sautéing the pancetta and aromatics before adding the various vegetables and simmering them with broth and tomatoes. A unique step involves puréeing half of the cooked white beans and stirring them back into the soup along with the remaining whole beans to thicken it and add texture. The soup is seasoned and served with Parmesan cheese, garlic bruschetta, and dry cured sausages.
