This recipe details a fresh, no-cook spaghetti dish. It features a sauce made from pureed beefsteak tomato, garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes, combined with halved cherry tomatoes and grated zucchini. Toasted hazelnuts add a nutty crunch, and the pasta is finished with a drizzle of olive oil and shaved ricotta salata.
