This recipe details how to prepare **Sheet-Pan Chicken Saltimbocca with Roasted Potatoes and Crispy Kale**. Boneless, skinless chicken cutlets are seasoned, topped with sage, wrapped in prosciutto, and baked on one sheet pan. Potatoes are tossed with garlic, sage, and seasonings, then roasted on a separate sheet pan. Kale is dressed with a unique anchovy-honey-vinegar mixture, then added to the potatoes for a final roast, resulting in tender potatoes and crispy kale served alongside the saltimbocca.
