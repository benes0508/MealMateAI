This recipe details how to prepare "Roasted Short Ribs With Cauliflower And Celery." Bone-in beef short ribs are slow-roasted with a garlic-rosemary-soy paste until fall-off-the-bone tender, then seared at a higher temperature for a deep crust. Cauliflower is roasted until soft, then puréed with cream into a smooth sauce. Hazelnuts are toasted and chopped. The dish is assembled by serving the short ribs over the cauliflower purée, topped with a fresh salad of celery, celery leaves, parsley, and toasted hazelnuts, dressed with oil and vinegar.
