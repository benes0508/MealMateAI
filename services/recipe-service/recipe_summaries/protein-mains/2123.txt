"Mexican Pasta Surprise" is a hearty, plant-based baked pasta dish. It combines bow tie pasta with a flavorful Mexican-inspired sauce made from vegetable broth, onion, jalape√±os, garlic, chipotle chili powder, stewed tomatoes, pinto beans, and enchilada sauce. The sauce is prepared on the stovetop, mixed with the cooked pasta, and then baked in a casserole dish. It's optionally garnished with fresh cilantro and tofu sour cream.
