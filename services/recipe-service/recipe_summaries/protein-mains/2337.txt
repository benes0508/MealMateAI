This recipe features a savory **Root Vegetable Zoodle Soup** with a rich base of hardwood smoked bacon, red onion, garlic, and herbs (oregano, thyme, bay leaf) simmered in low-sodium chicken broth. It includes spiralized (or matchstick) carrots, parsnips, and turnips, along with thinly sliced Brussels sprouts, cooked briefly to maintain an al dente texture. The soup is finished with a vibrant **basil oil** made with fresh basil, lemon zest, and olive oil (optional anchovy) drizzled over individual servings. It's designed to be made ahead of time.
