This recipe details how to prepare a Turkey Roulade with Cider Sauce. A boneless turkey breast is pounded thin, filled with a savory stuffing made from toasted bread, dried cranberries, saut√©ed vegetables (celery, onion, garlic, sage), and seared chicken livers. The stuffed turkey is rolled, tied, and first roasted uncovered until golden, then covered with foil and roasted further with a flavorful liquid base of sherry, soy sauce, apple cider, cloves, and bay leaf. After resting, the turkey is sliced and served with a pan sauce made by skimming fat from the roasting juices and thickening them with a cornstarch slurry.
