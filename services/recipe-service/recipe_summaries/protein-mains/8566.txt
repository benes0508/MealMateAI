This recipe details **Smoked Stuffed Chile Poppers**. Large, cored jalapeños are filled with a cream cheese and sharp cheddar mixture, then a pecan half, and wrapped in thin-sliced smoked bacon. They are then smoked over indirect heat with wood chips at 350°F for 1 hour and 15 minutes until the bacon is cooked and peppers are smoky, creating a cheesy, savory, and spicy appetizer.
