This recipe is for classic Chicken Cordon Bleu, featuring chicken breasts flattened and filled with thinly sliced country ham (or prosciutto) and Gruy√®re cheese, lightly spread with Dijon mustard. The filled chicken is then folded, coated in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs, and deep-fried in peanut oil until golden brown.
