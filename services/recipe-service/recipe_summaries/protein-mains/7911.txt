This recipe features a pork loin rubbed with a fragrant paste of lemon peel, garlic, rosemary, salt, pepper, and whole grain mustard. It's roasted alongside tender, pre-boiled baby artichokes, shallots, and unpeeled garlic cloves. The pork is initially seared at high heat, then roasted at a lower temperature with the vegetables until done. A rich vermouth and chicken broth jus is made by deglazing the pan drippings. The dish is served with sliced pork, roasted vegetables, and the savory jus.
