This recipe is for a "Pear, Mushroom and Pomegranate Stuffing," a savory-sweet side dish. It involves saut√©ing cremini mushrooms, celery, sage, and thyme, then combining them with cubed whole wheat baguette, anjou/bartlett pear, chopped prunes, low-sodium chicken broth, and pomegranate juice. The mixture is then baked in an 8" x 8" dish, covered initially, then uncovered until it puffs up.
