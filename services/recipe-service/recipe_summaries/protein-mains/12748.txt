This recipe details how to prepare Filipino-Style London Broil, featuring a steak (flank, sirloin, or round) marinated in a tangy and savory mixture of lemon juice, soy sauce, white vinegar, oil, onion, garlic, bay leaves, coriander seed, and pepper. The beef is marinated for at least 6 hours (ideally overnight), then grilled to medium-rare using various methods (contact, grill pan, built-in, freestanding, or fireplace grills). The cooked steak is thinly sliced and served with a reserved portion of the marinade as a sauce. The recipe also includes an adaptation for cooking tri-tip with a similar marinade.
