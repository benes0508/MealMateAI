This recipe describes how to make **Cheesy Corn Spoon Bread**, a savory, pudding-like baked dish. It involves creating a flavorful base by browning garlic in butter, then whisking it with creamed corn, cornmeal, eggs, sour cream, and seasonings. Grated Fontina cheese is mixed in before baking the spoon bread in a cast-iron skillet until golden brown and just set.
