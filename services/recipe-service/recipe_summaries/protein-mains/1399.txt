This recipe is for Arroz Caldo, a Filipino chicken rice porridge. It involves simmering a whole chicken to create a flavorful stock, then cooking a blend of glutinous and jasmine rice in that stock with saut√©ed onions, ginger, and garlic (some of which is fried separately for garnish). Fish sauce seasons the porridge, which is served with shredded chicken, crispy fried garlic, spring onions, hard-boiled eggs, and lime/kalamansi.
