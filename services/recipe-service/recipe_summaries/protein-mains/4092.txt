This recipe details a three-day process for a "Twice-Cooked Pork Roast with Fried-Herb Salsa Verde." Day one involves seasoning and refrigerating a pork shoulder. Day two, the pork is braised with vegetables and aromatics until very tender, then cooled overnight in its skimmed juices. On day three, the chilled pork is sliced and pan-seared until crispy, while the cooking liquid is reduced. It's served with a unique Fried-Herb Salsa Verde, made from crispy fried rosemary and sage, fresh parsley, garlic, and olive oil, spooned over the meat.
