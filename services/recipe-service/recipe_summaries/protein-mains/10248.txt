This recipe makes Coconut Rice Puddings topped with crispy coconut. The pudding combines light and regular coconut milk, rice, sugar, and shredded coconut, simmered until thick and creamy. A separate crispy coconut topping is prepared by baking unsweetened coconut shavings with egg white, sugar, vanilla, and salt until golden. The warm or room-temperature puddings are then garnished with the crispy coconut before serving.
