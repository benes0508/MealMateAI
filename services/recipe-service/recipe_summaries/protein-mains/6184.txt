This recipe details how to make "Bacon-Wrapped Pig Wings" by cutting boneless pork chops into strips, wrapping them with bacon, and seasoning with barbecue rub. They are then smoked indirectly at 235Â°F for 90 minutes, with an option to crisp the bacon on a hot grill or broiler. Serve hot with barbecue sauce for dipping.
