This recipe details how to make a Honey-Roasted Onion Tart. It involves preparing a puff pastry crust, cooking bacon, and then slow-roasting sweet yellow onions with a honey-wine-bacon dripping glaze until caramelized. A seasoned crème fraîche layer is spread on the pastry, topped with the roasted onions and bacon, then baked until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. The tart is garnished with fresh thyme.
