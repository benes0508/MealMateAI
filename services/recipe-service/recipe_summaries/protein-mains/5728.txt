This Black Pudding recipe creates a traditional savory blood sausage using fresh pig's blood, steel-cut oats, diced pork fat or beef suet, onion, milk, and spices. The mixture is baked in loaf pans until firm, then cooled for storage (refrigerate or freeze). It is served by slicing and pan-frying until crisped.
