This recipe details a versatile one-pan Skillet Chicken and Rice, offering two variations: a simpler "plain" version and a richer, "dirty" style. Both involve searing bone-in chicken pieces, then cooking long-grain white rice with aromatics (onions, bay leaf) and chicken broth in the same skillet until tender. The "dirty" version significantly enhances flavor with additions like mild pork sausage (optionally with chicken livers), bell pepper, celery, garlic, and cayenne pepper, cooked down before the rice is added, creating a dish reminiscent of classic Dirty Rice. The recipe finishes with optional frozen peas and fresh herbs like parsley or scallions.
