This recipe details how to prepare "All-Purpose Barbecue Ribs" using pork, lamb, or beef ribs coated in a dry rub. The ribs are slow-smoked at 200-225°F for 5-7 hours until they reach an internal temperature of 180°F and meat easily tears from the bone. After a 10-minute rest, they are cut and served, optionally with vinegar sauce.
