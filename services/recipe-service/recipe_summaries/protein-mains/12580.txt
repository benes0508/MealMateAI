This recipe is for **Turkish Lamb Kebabs**, featuring 1-inch cubes of boneless lamb leg seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil, then threaded onto skewers. An aromatic topping mixture is prepared from finely chopped red onion, parsley, diced tomato, oregano, Urfa and Maras peppers, olive oil, and salt. The lamb is grilled until medium-rare (6-8 minutes), and lavash bread is lightly grilled. Finally, the lamb is removed from skewers, divided among lavash pieces, topped with the tomato mixture, rolled up, and served immediately.
