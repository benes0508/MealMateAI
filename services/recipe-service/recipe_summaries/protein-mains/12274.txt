Tom Colicchio's Herb-Butter Turkey is a detailed recipe for a roasted whole turkey, generously flavored with a blend of fresh thyme, tarragon, rosemary, and sage in butter, applied both under and over the skin. It includes comprehensive instructions for a rich, homemade pan gravy, starting with a savory base made from turkey necks/wings and vegetables, then thickened with a roux using pan drippings. The turkey is roasted with precise temperature control, frequent basting, and broth additions to ensure a tender, moist result.
