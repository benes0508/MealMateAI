This recipe details how to make "My Boudin," a traditional Cajun sausage. It involves marinating and simmering pork shoulder and liver with vegetables (onion, celery, poblano, jalape√±o, garlic) and spices (salts, black/white/cayenne pepper, chili powder). After cooking, the solids are ground and mixed with cooked white rice, parsley, scallions, and reserved cooking liquid. The mixture can then be stuffed into sausage casings and poached, or used as a stuffing, or formed into "boudin balls" and fried.
