This recipe for "Green Gruel with Eyeballs" is a creative broccoli dish. It involves pureeing cooked broccoli stems, shallots, and garlic with broth and cheddar cheese to form a smooth "gruel." Blanched broccoli florets are stirred into the warmed puree. Hard-cooked eggs, prepared with black olives inserted, serve as "eyeballs" to top the individual servings of green gruel.
