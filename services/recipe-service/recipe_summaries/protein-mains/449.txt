This recipe for **Portobello Mushroom Wellington** is a vegetarian take on the classic. It involves roasting portobello mushrooms, caramelizing onions with thyme and Marsala, and preparing thin savory rosemary pancakes. These components are layered with wilted spinach, then rolled into a cylinder using the pancakes as a wrap. This filling is then encased in puff pastry, brushed with egg yolk and sprinkled with black onion seeds, and baked until golden. The dish is served with a rich tarragon cream sauce and steamed broccolini and kale.
