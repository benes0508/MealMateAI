This recipe details how to make Lasagna with Turkey Sausage Bolognese. It involves preparing a savory bolognese sauce with ground turkey sausage, tomatoes, onions, carrots, garlic, and herbs (basil, oregano, fennel), and a creamy cheese filling with ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. No-boil lasagna noodles are softened before layering with the sauce and cheese mixture in a baking dish, then baked until heated through and puffed.
