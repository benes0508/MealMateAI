Sausage Rolls are savory bites made with seasoned pork sausage wrapped in puff pastry. The sausage is mixed with dried herbs, formed into logs, enveloped in thawed puff pastry, egg-washed, cut, and baked at 375Â°F until golden brown (15-20 minutes). They can be served warm or cold and are suitable for freezing.
