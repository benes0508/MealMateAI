Ají de Gallina is a creamy Peruvian chicken dish featuring a rich, spicy sauce. Chicken pieces are browned and then roasted. The sauce is prepared by sautéing aromatics with turmeric and ají amarillo/mirasol chile paste, then simmering with milk-soaked bread, chicken broth, Parmesan, and walnuts, blended until smooth. The roasted chicken is served atop the sauce, garnished with boiled quail eggs, olives, and lime wedges, typically accompanied by Peruvian rice and lentils.
