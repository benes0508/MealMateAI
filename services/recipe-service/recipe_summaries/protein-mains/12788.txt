This recipe details how to prepare a savory, umami-rich sticky rice dish featuring long-grain Chinese sticky rice, Chinese sausage, dried scallops, and dried black mushrooms. The process involves extended soaking and steaming of the rice, scallops (with rice wine), and mushrooms, followed by steaming and slicing the Chinese sausage. All components are then stir-fried in a wok with scallions and a sauce made from oyster sauce, soy sauce, and the reserved soaking liquids, resulting in a complex, flavorful meal.
