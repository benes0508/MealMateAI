This recipe is for **Turkey Barbacoa Tacos with Black Beans**. Turkey drumsticks are marinated overnight in a smoky pur√©e of charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, ancho chiles, and sesame seeds. The marinated turkey is then wrapped in banana leaves and slow-baked until very tender. Meanwhile, dried black beans are cooked with carrots, celery, and onion until tender. The shredded turkey is served with its cooking liquid, the black beans, warm corn tortillas, salsa de chile morita, and queso fresco.
