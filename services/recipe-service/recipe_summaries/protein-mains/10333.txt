This Eggplant Cannelloni recipe features broiled eggplant slices filled with a savory mixture of goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and capers. These rolls are then nestled in a baking dish with a roasted red pepper sauce (made from shallots, garlic, roasted red peppers, and orange juice) and baked until tender, garnished with fresh parsley.
