This recipe creates a healthier "Mac 'n' Cheese" casserole using cauliflower instead of pasta. It involves microwaving cauliflower until tender, then combining it with a creamy, spiced cheese sauce made from milk, cream cheese, curry powder, Dijon mustard, mozzarella, and sharp cheddar. The casserole can be baked immediately, broiled for a browned topping, or frozen for up to three months. Instructions are provided for baking from frozen (oven or microwave for individual portions) and preparing ahead of time.
