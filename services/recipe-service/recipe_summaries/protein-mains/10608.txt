This recipe is for a "Ceviche" featuring scallops, shrimp, and squid, marinated in a tangy blend of orange/lime juice, ají amarillo chile purée, and red onion. The seafood is briefly poached until just tender, then drained and chilled in the marinade for at least 3 hours to develop flavors, and finally garnished with fresh cilantro before serving.
