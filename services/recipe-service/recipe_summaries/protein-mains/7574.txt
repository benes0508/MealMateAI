This "Easy Provençal Lamb" recipe features a bone-in leg of lamb coated with a flavorful mixture of Dijon mustard, garlic, rosemary, and balsamic vinegar. It's roasted with diced tomatoes, onion, olive oil, thyme, and honey, starting at a high temperature (450°F) then reduced to 350°F until medium-rare. The dish is served sliced with the roasted vegetables and pan juices.
