Turkey Gumbo is a hearty, make-ahead stew featuring cooked turkey and smoky Andouille sausage. It's built on a dark brown roux, incorporating the "holy trinity" of celery, onions, and bell peppers (with some vegetables pur√©ed into the roux) along with garlic. Simmered with chicken stock, thyme, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and Worcestershire, it thickens to a chowder-like consistency.
