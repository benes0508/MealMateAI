A flavorful turkey chili prepared with distinctive warm spices (allspice, cinnamon, cayenne) and a hint of unsweetened cocoa powder. Simmered with kidney beans and tomato sauce, it's served over tender roasted spaghetti squash instead of traditional grains, and garnished with fresh herbs and olives.
