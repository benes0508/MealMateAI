This Wild Rice Dressing with Roasted Grapes and Walnuts is a flavorful side dish. It combines wild and brown rice cooked with saut√©ed shallots and celery. The dressing is enhanced by the addition of roasted red and green grapes, toasted walnuts, and finely grated orange peel, all tossed with a hint of balsamic vinegar.
