This recipe details how to make Instant Pot Beef Barbacoa Tacos. Boneless beef chuck roast is seared, then pressure-cooked in an Instant Pot for 30 minutes with a flavorful sauce made from apple cider vinegar, lime juice, garlic, chipotle in adobo, cumin, oregano, and ground cloves, along with chicken broth and bay leaves. After natural pressure release, the beef is shredded and served hot in corn tortillas, topped with salsa and optional Cotija cheese.
