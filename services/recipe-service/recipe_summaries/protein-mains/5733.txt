This recipe details how to make **Stuffed Baby Potatoes**. Baby red potatoes are boiled until tender, then hollowed out. The scooped-out potato flesh is mashed with milk, then combined with a savory filling of cooked lean ground turkey (seasoned with salsa and spices), crispy bacon pieces, and shredded cheddar cheese. This mixture is spooned back into the potato skins, topped with more cheese, and baked until heated through.
