This recipe details how to prepare a **Roasted Turkey Breast with Corn Bread-Sage Stuffing and Brandy Gravy**. It involves saut√©ing aromatics (onion, celery, garlic, sage) with spices to create a stock-reduced mixture, then combining it with crumbled cornbread and eggs for the stuffing. A bone-in turkey breast is seasoned, oiled, and roasted atop the stuffing until cooked through. A rich gravy is made separately from demi-glace, brandy, butter, and cream to serve with the turkey and stuffing.
