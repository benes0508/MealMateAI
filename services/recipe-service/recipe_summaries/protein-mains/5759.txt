This recipe details how to make a **Chorizo and White Bean Stew**. It involves browning chorizo (or Italian sausage) and then cooking it with saut√©ed onion, garlic, and thyme. White cannellini beans and chicken broth are added and simmered until slightly thickened, with some beans crushed to aid consistency. Fresh spinach is wilted into the stew at the end, and the sliced chorizo is folded back in before serving. Smoked paprika and a drizzle of olive oil are optional garnishes.
