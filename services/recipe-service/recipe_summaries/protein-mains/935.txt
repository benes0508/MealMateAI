This recipe for Dry-Rubbed Turkey Breast utilizes a dry brine made from ground coriander, fennel, black peppercorns, salt, and brown sugar. The turkey breast is seasoned and then chilled for 12-48 hours. It's then roasted in a two-stage process: an initial high-heat blast at 450°F for browning, followed by a slower roast at 300°F until the internal temperature reaches 150°F, yielding a crispy skin and juicy meat. The breast is rested before slicing.
