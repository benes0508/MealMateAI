This recipe features **roasted chicken thighs** as a one-pan meal, cooked with **white beans, lemon slices, and capers**. Dijon mustard is spread on the chicken before it's nestled into a baking dish with the beans and capers, then roasted at 425Â°F for about 35 minutes. The dish yields a flavorful pan sauce and is finished with fresh parsley.
