This recipe details how to prepare a classic Meat Loaf with Mushroom Gravy. The meat loaf combines ground beef and veal with saut√©ed aromatics (onion, celery, marjoram, thyme), eggs, and panko bread crumbs, baked until tender and topped with tomato paste. A rich mushroom gravy is made separately using cremini mushrooms, shallots, veal stock, and heavy cream, served alongside slices of the meat loaf.
