This recipe details a Slow-Roasted Salmon with Harissa. A 2 lb salmon fillet is slow-roasted at 275Â°F with a mixture of olive oil, harissa paste, and grated garlic, along with lemon slices. The salmon is basted during cooking until flaky, then broken into pieces and served on a platter with the remaining harissa oil, a squeeze of fresh lemon, and mixed tender herbs.
