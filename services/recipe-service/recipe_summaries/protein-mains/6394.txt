This recipe features stir-fried shrimp and romaine hearts in a savory, tangy, and subtly sweet sauce, brightened with fresh garlic and ginger, and a hint of red pepper flakes for warmth. The dish is quick to prepare, with the romaine stir-fried just until wilted to retain some crispness, and is typically served over white rice.
