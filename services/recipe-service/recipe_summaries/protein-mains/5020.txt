This recipe details a Lamb Pot Roast with Oranges and Olives. A butterflied boneless lamb shoulder is seasoned, filled with garlic, mandarin orange slices, black olives, and herbs, then tied. It's first roasted at a high temperature to brown, then braised slowly in a rich liquid of beef stock, red wine, and tomato pur√©e until fork-tender. The dish offers a savory, aromatic flavor with notes of citrus and brininess from the olives, served with its flavorful braising liquid.
