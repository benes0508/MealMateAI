This recipe details how to make Gratin Dauphinoise, a classic French scalloped potato dish. It involves thinly slicing Yukon Gold potatoes and layering them with saut√©ed leeks, garlic, milk, and seasonings (salt, white pepper, nutmeg) in a baking dish. The dish is baked covered until tender, then uncovered with cream added, until golden and the cream is absorbed.
