This recipe for "The Ultimate Hamburger" features patties made from a blend of ground chuck and sirloin, seasoned with salt and pepper, and incorporating a thin onion wedge pressed directly into each patty. The burgers are grilled, along with lightly buttered sandwich bread used as buns. They are then assembled with lettuce, tomato, and optional cheese sauce.
