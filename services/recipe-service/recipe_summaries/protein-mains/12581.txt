This recipe details how to make **Chicken and Scallion Skewers**, featuring broiled chicken thigh and blanched scallions threaded onto skewers. A sweet and savory Japanese-inspired glaze (made from mirin, soy sauce, sake, and sugar) is reduced and brushed generously onto the skewers before and during broiling, with a final coating applied before serving.
