This recipe details how to make **Sheet-Pan Potato Hash with Fixins**. It involves thinly slicing and roasting russet potatoes on a sheet pan until very crisp. While the potatoes cool, eggs are fried. The dish is then assembled by topping the crisp potatoes with a fried egg, hot smoked fish (like salmon or trout), crème fraîche, roe, dill, and thinly sliced red onion.
