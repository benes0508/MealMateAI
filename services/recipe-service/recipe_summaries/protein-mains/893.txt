This recipe for Truffled Bay Scallops with Celery Purée involves preparing a smooth purée of celery, potato, and onion simmered in chicken stock (which can be made ahead). Bay scallops are quickly sautéed until just cooked, then finished with black truffle butter. The purée is then combined with the residual truffle butter in the skillet before plating, with scallops mounded on top and garnished with celery leaves.
