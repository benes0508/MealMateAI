This recipe is for **Smoked Baby Back Ribs with Hoisin-Honey Glaze**. Pork ribs are marinated overnight in an Asian-inspired blend of hoisin, honey, soy, oyster sauce, ginger, garlic, and Chinese five spice. They are then slow-smoked on a charcoal barbecue using an indirect heat method (250-300Â°F) for about 1.5 hours, basted frequently, resulting in tender, smoky ribs with a sweet and savory glaze.
