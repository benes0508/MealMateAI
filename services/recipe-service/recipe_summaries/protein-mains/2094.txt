A hearty pasta dish featuring a rich, slow-cooked chicken ragù. Bone-in chicken thighs are seared, then braised with crispy bacon, chopped fennel, onions, thyme, dry white wine, and whole milk until tender. The chicken is shredded and returned to the thickened, savory sauce, along with fresh or frozen peas. The ragù is then tossed with pappardelle pasta, butter, and Parmesan cheese, finished with fresh parsley and fennel fronds. This dish can be made ahead.
