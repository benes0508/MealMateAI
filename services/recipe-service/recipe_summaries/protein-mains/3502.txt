A Japanese-style Tonkatsu recipe featuring thinly sliced and pounded pork loin, breaded with flour, egg, and panko. Optionally, fresh shiso leaves are layered between pork slices before breading. The pork is pan-fried until golden and served with a simple homemade tonkatsu sauce (ketchup and Worcestershire).
