This recipe details how to make a classic Croque-Madame, a sophisticated French grilled ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg. It involves preparing a creamy Gruyère béchamel sauce, assembling sandwiches with ham and Dijon mustard, grilling them, then topping with more sauce before broiling until golden and bubbly. The final touch is a fried egg placed on each sandwich.
