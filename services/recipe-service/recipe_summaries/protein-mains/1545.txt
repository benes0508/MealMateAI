This recipe details making **Spiced Praline Meringues**. It involves creating a spiced almond praline by caramelizing sugar with almonds and then combining it with cinnamon, cloves, orange zest, and salt. Separately, egg whites are whipped with hot sugar (a Swiss meringue method) until thick and glossy. The meringue is then shaped into large balls, sprinkled with the praline mixture, and baked slowly for over two hours until firm on the outside with a slightly soft center. The meringues can be stored for up to 10 days.
