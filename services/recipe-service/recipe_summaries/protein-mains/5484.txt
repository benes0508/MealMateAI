This recipe is for **Pasta All'Amatriciana**, a classic Italian dish featuring a rich, savory tomato sauce with guanciale (pork jowl) and pancetta (Italian bacon).

**Key ingredients include:** Canned whole peeled tomatoes, onion, guanciale, pancetta, olive oil, red pepper flakes, tomato paste, dry white wine, and penne or other tube-shaped pasta, finished with Pecorino or Parmesan cheese.

**Preparation involves:** Puréeing tomatoes, cooking the aromatics and meats until fat renders, adding tomato paste and wine to reduce, then simmering the tomato purée for 40-45 minutes until the sauce is flavorful and tender. Pasta is cooked separately, then tossed with the finished sauce and served with cheese. The sauce can be made up to 4 days in advance.
