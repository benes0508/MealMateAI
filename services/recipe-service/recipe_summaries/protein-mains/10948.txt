This recipe for Puebla-style Chicken Mole involves first parboiling chicken and reserving the broth. The complex mole sauce is prepared by cleaning, frying, soaking, and pureeing various dried chiles. Separately, a blend of spices (cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, seeds) and roasted garlic is pureed with tomatillos. Another blend of fried ingredients, including raisins, almonds, pumpkin seeds, tortillas, and bread, is then incorporated into the tomatillo mixture using reserved chicken broth. Finally, the chile puree, the blended tomatillo-nut mixture, and Mexican chocolate are combined and simmered for an extended period, with the chicken added during the last 15 minutes to heat through. The dish is garnished with toasted sesame seeds and served with white rice.
