This recipe details how to make **Vermicelli Noodles with Lemongrass Pork Meatballs**. It involves preparing aromatic pork meatballs with finely minced lemongrass, then broiling them. Concurrently, you'll make a flavorful **nuoc cham-style dressing** with fish sauce, lime, and chile, and crispy **fried shallots** (reserving the infused oil). Rice vermicelli noodles are cooked and tossed with a little shallot oil. To serve, arrange the noodles, fresh vegetables (carrots, cucumber, lettuce), and herbs (mint, cilantro) on a platter. Diners assemble their bowls with noodles, veggies, herbs, meatballs, a drizzle of dressing, fried shallots, and chopped peanuts.
