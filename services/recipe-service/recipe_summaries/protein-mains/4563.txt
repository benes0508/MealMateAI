This recipe for Shrimp with Fresh Corn Grits outlines a two-part preparation: fresh corn grits and seasoned shrimp with corn kernels. Grits are simmered with chicken broth, milk, and water, then finished with butter and grated fresh corn for enhanced flavor and texture. Simultaneously, shrimp are cooked in a skillet with garlic, oregano, and smoked paprika alongside corn kernels until fragrant and tender. The dish is served by spooning the shrimp and corn mixture over the creamy grits, garnished with fresh chives.
