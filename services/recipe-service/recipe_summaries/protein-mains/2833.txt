This recipe details Soy-Basted Chicken Kebabs. Chicken thighs are marinated in a sweet and savory mixture of soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, and rice vinegar. The remaining marinade is reduced to a syrupy glaze. The chicken is skewered, grilled over direct heat until browned, then moved to indirect heat, basted with the glaze until fully cooked. It's finished with a flavorful sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds, chives, Aleppo pepper, and lemon zest.
