This recipe is for **Wine-Braised Brisket with Tart Cherries**. A beef brisket is dredged in a matzoh meal mixture, browned, then braised in the oven with shallots, garlic, Pinot Noir, chicken stock, dried tart cherries, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and star anise until fork-tender. Blanched carrots are added during the final braising stage. The dish is served with the rich sauce and carrots, with the star anise discarded before serving.
