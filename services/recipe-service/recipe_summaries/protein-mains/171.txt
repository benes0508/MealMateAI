This recipe details making Pulled Pork Sandwiches. A Boston butt pork roast is seasoned with a dry rub (paprika, chili powder, cumin, sugars, salt, peppers, oregano) and marinated for at least 3 hours. Concurrently, a tangy BBQ sauce is prepared from ketchup, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, chili powder, and cayenne, then simmered until thickened. The marinated pork is slow-smoked on a grill for 5-6 hours until fork-tender (internal temperature 165Â°F), then shredded and tossed with the prepared barbecue sauce to be served on buns.
