This recipe is for **Grilled Pork Chops with Sweet Lemongrass Marinade**. Bone-in pork chops are marinated in a blend of sugar, fish sauce, lemongrass, garlic, shallot, chile, and black pepper. They are then grilled using a two-zone heat method (hot and cooler zones) to achieve a flavorful exterior and a juicy interior (target 140Â°F), before resting and being sliced off the bone for serving.
