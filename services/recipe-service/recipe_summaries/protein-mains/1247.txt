This recipe details how to prepare Pan-Seared Ribeye with Miso Butter, utilizing a reverse sear method for thick steaks. Ribeye steaks are seasoned and gently warmed in a 275°F (135°C) oven until they reach a specific internal temperature (e.g., 90-95°F for medium-rare). They are then transferred to a preheated cast-iron skillet for a high-heat sear to develop a deep brown crust, followed by basting with butter, garlic, and green onions. The steaks are rested before serving, topped with a flavorful miso butter made from softened butter, yellow miso, and green onions.
