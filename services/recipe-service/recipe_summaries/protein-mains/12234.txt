This recipe details a savory Corn Custard featuring browned chorizo, sautéed cremini mushrooms, and jalapeño, layered in a baking dish. A creamy custard base is made by puréeing corn with cream cheese, cornmeal, and sugar, then whisked with eggs, milk, salt, scallions, and Monterey Jack cheese (along with whole corn kernels). This mixture is poured over the savory ingredients and baked at 375°F until puffed, set, and golden, served warm or at room temperature.
