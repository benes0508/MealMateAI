Spiced Lamb Meatballs with Walnut Romesco features flavorful lamb meatballs infused with toasted and ground coriander, cumin, paprika, and cayenne, alongside a finely chopped, moisture-extracted mix of onion, cilantro, and parsley, then pan-fried until browned. They are served with a rich Romesco sauce made from pureeing toasted walnuts with roasted red bell pepper, tomato, and garlic, brightened with sherry vinegar and a touch of chipotle.
