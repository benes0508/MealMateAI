This recipe for **Roasted Cauliflower Larb** offers a vegetarian (contains fish sauce) take on the classic Thai/Laotian salad. Roasted cauliflower florets are finely chopped and tossed with a vibrant dressing of green Thai chiles, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and lime juice.

It's served with crisp bibb lettuce leaves and sliced cucumber for making refreshing lettuce cups.
