This recipe details how to make Stuffed Shells with Marinara. Jumbo pasta shells are cooked al dente, then filled with a mixture of ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella, eggs, and parsley. The stuffed shells are baked in a dish layered with marinara sauce and mozzarella, initially covered, then broiled briefly to achieve a golden-brown top. It's a make-ahead friendly dish.
