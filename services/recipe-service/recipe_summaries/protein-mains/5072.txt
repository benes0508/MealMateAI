This elaborate dessert features poached Seckel pears, an aromatic Szechuan pepper ice cream, sharp Cabrales cheese, and a baked almond diamond. The recipe involves infusing milk for the spicy ice cream base, poaching pears in pomegranate juice to create a sauce, and baking an almond flour mixture. The final dish is assembled by combining the cored pears with cheese, glazing them, and serving with the ice cream and almond pastry.
