This recipe details how to make classic Twice-Baked Potatoes. Whole russet potatoes are baked until tender, then their creamy flesh is scooped out and mashed with sour cream, butter, fresh chives, and optional tarragon. This flavorful mixture is then re-stuffed into the potato skins and baked a second time until puffed and golden brown. Optional additions like bacon, cheddar cheese, or chili can be added for extra flavor.
