This recipe is for **Shrimp and Coconut Rolls**, a fresh and light dish. It involves combining cooked shrimp, iceberg lettuce, fresh coconut, cucumber, green onion, and mint with a dressing of lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and serrano chiles. This mixture is then rolled tightly into **rice paper wrappers** (spring roll style). A separate **dipping sauce** is prepared from lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and chiles. The rolls can be made ahead of time and refrigerated.
