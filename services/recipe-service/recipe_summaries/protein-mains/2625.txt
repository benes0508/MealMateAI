This recipe details how to make **Shredded Sweet Potato and Carrot Fritters (Ukoy)**, a Filipino-inspired dish. It involves thinly slicing sweet potatoes and carrots into matchsticks, combining them with peeled shrimp and cilantro, then coating with a batter made from club soda, fish sauce, and cornstarch. The mixture is deep-fried in hot oil (330-340Â°F) until golden brown and crisp. The fritters are served immediately with a flavorful dipping sauce made from chiles, garlic, onion, and vinegar.
