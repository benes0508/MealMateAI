This recipe features seared and braised chicken leg and thigh pieces cooked in a rich sauce with ras-el-hanout, white wine, chicken broth, carrots, and shallots. Sweet brown turkey figs are added to the reduced pan juices at the end. Served over couscous, this dish offers a savory and subtly sweet Moroccan-inspired flavor.
