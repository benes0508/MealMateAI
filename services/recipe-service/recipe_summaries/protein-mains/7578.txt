This recipe details how to make **Beer Can Chicken** on a grill. A whole chicken is seasoned with a homemade or favorite dry barbecue rub, then a beer can (with some rub mixed in) is inserted into its cavity. The chicken is cooked upright on a grill using indirect heat until it's tender, with the beer steaming the chicken from the inside.
