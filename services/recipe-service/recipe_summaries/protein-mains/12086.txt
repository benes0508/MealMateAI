This recipe details how to make **Chicken Liver Mousse**. It involves saut√©ing shallots and garlic, deglazing with Cognac, then blending with chicken livers, egg yolks, milk, flour, and spices (salt, pepper, nutmeg, allspice) until smooth. The mixture is then baked in a water bath until set, topped with clarified butter and bay leaves, and finally chilled thoroughly before serving.
