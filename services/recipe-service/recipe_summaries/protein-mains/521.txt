This recipe details how to make a **Pork Katsu Sandwich**. It involves marinating boneless pork loin with shio koji and salt, preparing a lemon-dressed cabbage slaw, then breading the pork with flour, egg, and panko before deep-frying until golden. The fried pork cutlets are then assembled into sandwiches with milk bread, tonkatsu sauce, dijon mustard, and the cabbage slaw.
