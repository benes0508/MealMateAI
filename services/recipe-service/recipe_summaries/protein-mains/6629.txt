This recipe details how to prepare a **Chard and Mushroom-Stuffed Breast of Veal**. A boneless veal breast is pounded thin, seasoned with a paprika-sage spice blend, and filled with a savory stuffing made from saut√©ed leeks, onions, garlic, rehydrated porcini and crimini mushrooms, Swiss chard, bread, Parmesan, and eggs. The stuffed veal is rolled, tied, seared, and then slowly braised in the oven for 2.5-3 hours with aromatic vegetables, white wine, and chicken broth. The braising liquid is then transformed into a rich, smooth sauce to be served with slices of the tender veal.
