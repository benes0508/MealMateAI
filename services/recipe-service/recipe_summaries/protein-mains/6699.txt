This recipe details how to make a **Grass-Fed Beef Meatloaf** encased in a **bacon blanket**. It combines ground beef and pork with sautéed aromatics (onion, carrot, celery, garlic), breadcrumbs soaked in milk, ketchup, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings. The loaf is formed, topped with halved bacon slices, then roasted at 375°F until it reaches 160°F internally, with an optional broil for crisp bacon. It requires a 10-minute rest before serving.
