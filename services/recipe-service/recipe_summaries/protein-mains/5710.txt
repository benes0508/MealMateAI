This recipe for "Chile-Braised Short Ribs" features beef short ribs marinated overnight in a pur√©e of rehydrated New Mexico chiles, garlic, lemon, and spices. The ribs and onions are then slow-braised in chicken broth in the oven, with potatoes, carrots, and tomato paste added later, until the meat is fork-tender. The braising liquid is reduced to create a rich sauce, finished with green olives and fresh parsley, and served over the short ribs and vegetables.
