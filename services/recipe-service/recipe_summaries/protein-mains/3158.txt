This recipe features **Fig-Braised Chicken with Spiced Walnuts**. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are marinated in a sweet and tangy blend of saut√©ed dried figs, cherries, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. The chicken is then browned in a skillet, simmered with the reserved marinade and bone broth, and finished by braising in the oven. Separately, walnuts are toasted with olive oil, sea salt, and paprika for a spiced topping. The dish is served garnished with the toasted walnuts and fresh parsley.
