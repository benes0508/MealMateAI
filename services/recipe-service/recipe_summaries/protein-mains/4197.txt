This recipe features **Duck-Fat Turkey Breasts with Green Onion Puree**. A turkey breast (preferably brined) is seared in duck fat until golden, then roasted with butter, thyme, and garlic until it reaches 155Â°F, basted every 15 minutes. While the turkey rests, a puree is made by simmering green onions in vegetable stock, then blending them with cream cheese and salt. The sliced turkey is served with this smooth green onion puree.
