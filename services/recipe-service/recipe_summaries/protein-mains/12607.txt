This recipe details how to prepare a **Chicken and Green Bean Coconut Curry**. It involves extracting liquid from tamarind, toasting and grinding whole spices (coriander, cumin, curry leaves, red chiles), and browning chicken breast halves with skin and bones. The chicken is then simmered in a sauce made from coconut milk, tamarind liquid, saut√©ed onions, garlic, turmeric, and the ground spice mixture. Green beans are blanched and added towards the end, and the curry is finished with an aromatic tempering of hot oil, mustard seeds, fresh curry leaves, and chiles.
