This recipe describes `Chicken Under a Brick with Fresh Herb and Garlic Sauce`. Boneless chicken breast halves are marinated in a vibrant sauce made with blanched and raw garlic, fresh herbs (parsley, mint, basil), oregano, red pepper, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. The chicken is then grilled skin-side down under foil-wrapped bricks to achieve crispy skin before being flipped and cooked through. It's served with the remaining fresh herb and garlic sauce.
