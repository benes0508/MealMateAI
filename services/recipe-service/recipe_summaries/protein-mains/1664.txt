This recipe details how to make Classic Spaghetti and Meatballs. It involves preparing a slow-simmered tomato sauce with garlic and basil. The meatballs are made from ground beef, rehydrated white bread, eggs, ricotta, prosciutto, Parmesan, and a distinctive blend of spices including fennel, oregano, and nutmeg. These are browned and then simmered in the rich tomato sauce until tender. Spaghetti is cooked al dente, tossed with the sauce, and served topped with the meatballs and additional Parmesan.
