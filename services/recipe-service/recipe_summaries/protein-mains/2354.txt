The "Slow Cooker Veggie-Loaded Marinara" is a straightforward, make-ahead sauce. It combines tomatoes, tomato paste, and a mix of chopped vegetables (carrots, celery, onion, red bell pepper, garlic) with classic herbs. All ingredients are slow-cooked together for 6 hours on low, then blended to the desired consistency.
