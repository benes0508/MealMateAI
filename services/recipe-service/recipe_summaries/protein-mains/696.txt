Shrimp and Basil Stir-Fry is a quick, flavorful Asian-inspired main dish. It features shrimp marinated in a zesty, spicy blend of fresno chiles, garlic, fish sauce, and sugar. The shrimp are then quickly stir-fried until browned, with fresh basil tossed in at the end for vibrant aroma. Serve with rice and lime wedges.
