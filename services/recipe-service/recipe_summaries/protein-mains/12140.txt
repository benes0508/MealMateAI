This recipe is for **Spice-Rubbed Grilled Pork Chops**. Bone-in pork chops are coated in a dry rub of paprika, black pepper, salt, sugar, chili, garlic, onion, and cayenne powders, then refrigerated for 1-8 hours. The chops are then grilled for 18-20 minutes until a hint of pink remains at the center, served hot.
