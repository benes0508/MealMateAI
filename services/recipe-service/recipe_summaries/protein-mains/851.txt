This recipe details how to make Classic Smashed Cheeseburgers using a blend of freshly ground sirloin and brisket. Patties are briefly frozen before being smashed thinly on a hot griddle until deeply browned and crisp. They are topped with melted American cheese, served on toasted potato rolls with tomato, lettuce, and a "Not-So-Secret Sauce."
