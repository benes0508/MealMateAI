This recipe prepares wood-grilled oysters, featuring a spicy chipotle vinaigrette. Oysters are shucked, topped with the vinaigrette (made from vinegars, garlic, and chipotle chiles in adobo), and quickly grilled over wood chips (hickory or mesquite) until their edges curl. Served with additional vinaigrette.
