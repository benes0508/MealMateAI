Leg of Lamb "Black and Tan" features a butterflied leg of lamb seasoned with balsamic vinegar, garlic, and lemon pepper. It's slow-grilled indirectly over a water pan for tenderness. A rich, unique sauce is made by roasting lamb bones and vegetables, then reducing them with beef broth, Guinness Extra Stout, Harp Lager Beer, and honey mustard, finished with butter and honey. The sauce can be prepared ahead.
