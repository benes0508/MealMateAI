This recipe is for **Mexican Ceviche Tacos**. Sushi-grade fish (like tuna or hamachi) is cubed and "cooked" in a citrus marinade (lime, lemon, sugar) until opaque. The strained ceviche is then mixed with tomatoes, red onion, pickled jalape√±os, lettuce, avocado, and cilantro, and served in crisp taco shells topped with salsa. It requires at least 4 hours of chilling for the fish.
