This recipe is for **Rosemary-Rubbed Side of Salmon with Roasted Potatoes, Parsnips, and Mushrooms**. A fragrant rub of fresh rosemary, salt, pepper, and olive oil is prepared. Potatoes and parsnips are initially roasted with some of the rub. The salmon is then coated with the remaining rub, and mushrooms are added to the vegetables. Both are roasted together at 450Â°F until the salmon is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Finally, the pan juices from the vegetables are deglazed with red wine and drizzled over the salmon, which is served on a bed of salad greens alongside the roasted vegetables.
