This recipe is for a "Two-Way" bread stuffing featuring **chanterelle mushrooms, pears, and pancetta**. The process involves drying firm white bread, then saut√©ing the various aromatic ingredients, mushrooms, and pears with butter and white wine. These are combined with the dried bread, fresh herbs, and turkey or chicken stock. The "Two-Way" aspect allows the stuffing to be used to **fill a turkey cavity** and also baked separately as **individual muffin-shaped portions** or in a casserole.

**Likely Collection**: `protein-mains` or `comfort-cooked`
