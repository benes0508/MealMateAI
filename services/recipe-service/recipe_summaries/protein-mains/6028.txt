Duck Ã  l'Orange is a classic French dish featuring pan-seared duck pieces (breasts, legs, wings) cooked until golden and tender. A rich, flavorful sauce is prepared from homemade duck stock (made with giblets, carcass, and aromatics including orange peel), Port wine, and fresh orange juice. The dish is finished by serving the duck over the warm sauce, garnished with fresh orange segments and thinly sliced orange peel, offering a delightful balance of savory and citrus notes.
