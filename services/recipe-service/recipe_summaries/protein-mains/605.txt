This "Smash Burger Alfresco" recipe guides you through making classic smash burgers on a grill using a cast-iron griddle. It features thin, crispy ground beef patties, each topped with American cheese, served on warmed potato rolls with iceberg lettuce, thinly sliced onion, tomato, and a homemade "special sauce" made from mayonnaise, ketchup, dill pickles, and chipotle adobo sauce.
