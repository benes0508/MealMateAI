This recipe is for a **Pasta with 15-Minute Meat Sauce**, featuring a quick-cooking blend of ground beef and pork (or plant-based alternatives) with finely chopped onion, celery, carrot, and garlic. The sauce is built with tomato paste, oregano, red wine, and tomato sauce, simmered briefly, and finished with butter. It's tossed with cooked pasta and served with Parmesan, and can be stored refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.
