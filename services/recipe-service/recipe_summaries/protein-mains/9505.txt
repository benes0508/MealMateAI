This recipe details how to prepare **Gorgonzola Chicken Breasts**. Chicken breast halves are horizontally cut, stuffed with sliced gorgonzola dolce cheese, then pan-seared until golden before being oven-baked until cooked through. A simple pan sauce is made from water and balsamic vinegar, deglazing the skillet and reducing slightly to serve alongside the chicken.
