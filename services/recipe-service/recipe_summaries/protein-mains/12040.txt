Fresh Herb Spaetzle features a dough made from flour, eggs, milk, and fresh herbs (like parsley, thyme, rosemary, chives). The batter is pressed through a grater into boiling water, then cooked until tender. The spaetzle is then saut√©ed with mushrooms and onions, simmered in chicken broth, and finished with a final addition of fresh herbs.
