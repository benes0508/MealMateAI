This recipe details a Pan Bagnat, a classic pressed sandwich. It features olive oil-packed tuna, thinly sliced fennel, briny olives, cucumber, and hard-boiled eggs layered on ciabatta bread. The ingredients are tossed in a vibrant dressing of olive oil, white wine vinegar, capers, and red pepper flakes, then assembled and pressed for two hours to allow the flavors to meld. The fennel-olive mixture can be prepared up to two days in advance.
