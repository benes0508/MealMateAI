This recipe is for **Big Red Slow-Cooker Pulled Pork**. A pork shoulder is rubbed with a spice blend (cumin, paprika, cayenne, salt, pepper) and slow-cooked for about 8 hours in a mixture of Big Red soda and barbecue sauce until tender. The cooked pork is then shredded and tossed with more barbecue sauce and Big Red. It's suggested to serve with extra sauce, or as sandwiches with buns, slaw, and pickles. Prep can be done a day ahead, and cooked pork stored for up to 3 days.
