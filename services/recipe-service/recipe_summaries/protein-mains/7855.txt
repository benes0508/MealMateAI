Ino's Pancetta, Arugula, and Tomato Sandwich offers a gourmet take on a classic. It features gently cooked pancetta, fresh sliced tomatoes seasoned with olive oil and salt, and peppery arugula, layered on sourdough bread with a zesty lemon aioli. The assembled sandwich is then buttered (or oiled) and grilled in a panini press or on a grill until golden and crispy.
