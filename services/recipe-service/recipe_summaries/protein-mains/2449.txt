This Thanksgiving Skillet Pizza repurposes holiday leftovers into a unique pizza. It features cooked turkey (or chicken), mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and various Thanksgiving vegetables, all topped with cheese. The pizza dough is first crisped in a hot cast-iron skillet, then flipped, topped, and finished baking in the oven.
