This recipe offers an elevated Beef Stroganoff featuring pan-seared beef tenderloin steaks, served with a rich, emulsified mushroom purée (with optional truffle oil), intensely peppered crème fraîche, and fresh dill. The accompanying homemade Peppered Spaetzle is sautéed until golden and tossed with a unique caramelized shallot marmalade and reserved sautéed mushrooms. Multiple components can be prepared in advance.
