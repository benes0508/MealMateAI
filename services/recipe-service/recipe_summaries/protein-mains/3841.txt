This recipe details how to prepare pan-seared and oven-baked chicken thighs, pre-marinated in distilled white vinegar for flavor. It's served with a side of butter-sautÃ©ed radishes and mustard greens, which are cooked until tender-crisp and lightly wilted, then finished with fresh tarragon and a touch more vinegar.
