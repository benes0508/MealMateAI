A unique take on the classic Croque Madame, this recipe features grilled ham and aged white cheddar cheese sandwiches enhanced with a sweet and tangy cranberry-mustard relish. Each is topped with a fried egg, and a distinctive technique crisps melted cheese around the bread in the oven for a delicious crust. Ideal for using leftover cranberry sauce.
