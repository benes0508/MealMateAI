Yam Kai (Thai Eggs) is a quick, Thai-inspired dish utilizing leftover cooked grains (such as barley, quinoa, or brown rice) and optional leftover pork. It features eggs, caramelized shallots, and scallions, seasoned with lime juice, fish sauce, and chile paste for a savory, tangy, and spicy profile.
