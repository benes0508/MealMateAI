This recipe details how to prepare a **Citrus-Sage Roast Turkey with Gravy**, ideal for a large crowd. A 13-15 pound turkey is seasoned with a butter mixture infused with fresh sage and lemon/orange zest, applied under the skin. The turkey is then stuffed with orange and onion wedges, roasted at high heat (425°F) initially, then at 350°F, basting frequently until it reaches 165°F. After resting, pan juices are used to create a rich gravy, deglazed from the roasting pan and thickened with a butter-flour roux and turkey stock.
