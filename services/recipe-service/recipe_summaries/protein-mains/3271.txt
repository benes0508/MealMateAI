This recipe details how to make **Lasagna Roll-Ups**, a comforting pasta dish. It involves boiling lasagna noodles, preparing a rich meat sauce with ground beef, diced tomatoes, and saut√©ed vegetables (onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, garlic), and a creamy cheese filling made from ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs, parsley, and basil. Each noodle is spread with the cheese filling, rolled up, placed in a baking pan, and topped with the meat sauce and more cheese before being baked until hot and bubbly, or frozen for later. Serve with a side salad and bread.
