This recipe details how to make **Crumb-Covered Poached Eggs**, a unique dish featuring soft-yolk poached eggs encased in a crispy, savory crust.

**Key Steps:**
1.  **Prepare seasoned crumbs:** Cook and finely chop bacon. Toast panko breadcrumbs in bacon fat and butter, then combine with the chopped bacon and seasonings (cayenne, salt, pepper).
2.  **Poach and chill eggs:** Poach eggs until whites are set but yolks are soft, then immediately cool them in an ice bath. Trim and pat dry.
3.  **Coat eggs:** Dredge the cold, dry poached eggs first in flour, then in beaten egg, and finally generously coat them in the seasoned crumbs.
4.  **Bake:** Bake the crumb-coated eggs at 350Â°F for 10-15 minutes until golden brown and warmed through.

The recipe also provides variations for the crumbs, including Pancetta and Parmigiano, Tarragon and Parsley, or Chorizo.
