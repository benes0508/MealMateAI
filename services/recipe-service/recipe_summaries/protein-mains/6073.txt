This recipe details how to make homemade Ricotta-Filled Ravioli (Ravioli di Ricotta). It involves preparing a savory ricotta filling with nutmeg, lemon zest, and Parmesan, and then making fresh pasta dough from flour, eggs, and egg yolks. The ravioli are assembled by spooning the filling onto pasta sheets, folding, sealing, and cutting, then boiled for 2-3 minutes until tender, and served with a desired sauce or cheese.
