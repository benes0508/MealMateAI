This recipe for Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs primarily utilizes leftover corned beef, potatoes, cabbage, and root vegetables. The hash is prepared by saut√©ing fat trimmings and red onion, then combining them with the chopped leftovers, binding with beaten eggs, and pan-frying until golden and crispy. Separately, eggs are poached to a soft set, either prepared ahead or concurrently, and served atop the finished hash.
