This recipe describes how to make Shrimp and Cotija Enchiladas with homemade Salsa Verde. It involves roasting tomatillos, poblano chiles, and garlic for a vibrant salsa. Shrimp are then quickly saut√©ed with red onion, oregano, and cumin to form the filling, along with some of the roasted poblanos and cotija cheese. Corn tortillas are dipped in salsa, filled, rolled, and baked, then served with additional salsa, crema, and fresh garnishes.
