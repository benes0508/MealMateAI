"Herbed Chicken and Squash" is an oven-roasted main course featuring bone-in, skinless chicken breasts alongside butternut squash and cipollini onions. Seasoned with rosemary, salt, and pepper, the dish is finished with a sweet and savory apricot-mustard glaze on the chicken, resulting in a flavorful roasted meal.
