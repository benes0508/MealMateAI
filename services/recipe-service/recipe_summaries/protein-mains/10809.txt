"Grilled Giant Pork Chops with Adobo Paste" details a two-stage grilling method for thick bone-in pork chops. The chops are coated in a homemade adobo-style spice paste (featuring olive oil, paprika, oregano, garlic, cumin, red pepper flakes, lime zest, salt, and pepper), then seared over direct heat for browning before finishing over indirect heat until they reach an internal temperature of 145Â°F. A brief resting period follows before serving.
