This recipe features **Barbecue Pork Kebabs** seasoned with a sweet and spicy dry rub (brown sugar, mustard, paprika, garlic, cayenne). Thinly sliced pork is skewered, heavily coated with the rub, and grilled using both direct and indirect heat until cooked through and slightly charred. The kebabs are served with a unique **Blistered-Chile–Pumpkin Seed Salsa** made from charred jalapeños and white onions, combined with fresh cilantro, pumpkin seeds, olive oil, and lime juice.
