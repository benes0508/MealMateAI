This recipe describes how to make Microwave Lasagna with Spinach, Mushrooms, and Three Cheeses. It involves layering no-boil lasagna noodles with a mixture of part-skim ricotta, spinach, garlic, and mozzarella/Parmesan, along with marinara sauce and crimini mushrooms, in an 8x8 inch microwave-proof dish. The lasagna is covered and microwaved for 15 minutes until tender, then rested before serving with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan.
