This recipe details how to prepare Ricotta-and-Herb-Stuffed Chicken. Whole chickens are butterflied and stuffed under the skin with a savory mixture of ricotta cheese, minced garlic, Parmesan, eggs, and fresh herbs like oregano and parsley. The chickens are then baked at 400Â°F, alongside a separate dish of the remaining ricotta mixture (which bakes into a gratin), until cooked through and golden.
