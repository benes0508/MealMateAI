This recipe features a **roasted veal strip loin**, first seared then roasted. It is served with a sophisticated **cherry-red grape sauce** made from reduced red wine, broths, and a blend of grapes and wild cherries. **Optional slices of cooked duck foie gras** are served atop the veal for an added luxurious touch. The veal benefits from overnight chilling after herb seasoning, and the sauce can be prepared ahead, making it ideal for a special occasion.
