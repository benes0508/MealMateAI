This recipe details how to make Beef Short Ribs Satay. Korean kalbi-style beef short ribs are marinated for 24 hours (minimum 6) in a flavorful paste of lemongrass, ginger, shallots, garlic, oyster sauce, fish sauce, turmeric, and coconut milk. The ribs are then grilled until very hot, basted with a mix of reserved marinade and coconut milk, and cooked for about 2 minutes per side. Serve the rested ribs with satay peanut sauce, cucumber ajat, and optional rice or bread.
