This recipe details how to prepare **Citrus-Cured Salmon**, a dry-cured dish. A salmon fillet is cured for 24 hours under weight with a mixture of kosher salt, granulated and brown sugars, black peppercorns, coriander, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes. Fresh lemon, lime, and orange zests are spread directly on the fish before curing. After the process, the salmon is rinsed, dried, and thinly sliced, suitable for make-ahead preparation.
