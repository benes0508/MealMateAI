**Roast Turkey with Port Gravy** outlines a comprehensive method for preparing a 13-14 pound roasted turkey. The recipe features a homemade stock from turkey giblets, used for both basting and as the base for a rich gravy, which is deglazed with tawny Port wine and thickened with a butter-flour paste.
