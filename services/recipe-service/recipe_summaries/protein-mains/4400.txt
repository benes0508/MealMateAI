This Filipino-style Chicken Adobo features chicken legs marinated in a classic adobo blend of soy sauce, cider vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. After marinating for two hours, the chicken is baked in its flavorful liquid until cooked through, then finished under the broiler for crispy skin. The marinade is reduced into a savory sauce to be served alongside the chicken, typically with cooked rice.
