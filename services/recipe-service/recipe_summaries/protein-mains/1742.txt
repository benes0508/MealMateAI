This recipe details how to prepare "Fish Packets with Snap Peas, Tomatoes, and Herb Butter." It involves preheating the oven to 400Â°F, preparing an herb butter (with butter, herbs, salt, pepper), and assembling individual parchment paper packets. Each packet contains a spoonful of herb butter, snap peas, quartered cherry tomatoes, sliced garlic, and a fish fillet (flounder or tilapia), topped with more herb butter and seasoning. The packets are crimped shut and baked for about 13 minutes until the fish is cooked through. The dish is finished with fresh basil. Components can be prepped ahead of time.
