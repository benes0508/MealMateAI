The End-of-the-Week Deli Sandwich is a warm, toasted sandwich built on ciabatta or rustic bread. The bread is spread with a pesto-mayo mix, topped with cheese, and baked until lightly toasted. It's then filled with assorted deli meats (like salami, ham, turkey), peperoncini, red onion, tomatoes, and arugula. The recipe yields 6 sandwiches.
