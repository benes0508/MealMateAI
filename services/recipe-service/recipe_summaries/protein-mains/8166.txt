This recipe details how to make **Chicken Tamales with Tomatillo-Cilantro Sauce**. It involves poaching and shredding chicken, then combining it with a vibrant tomatillo-cilantro-jalape√±o sauce to create the filling. Masa dough is prepared by beating lard until fluffy and mixing with masa harina and chicken broth. Corn husks are soaked, then spread with masa, filled with the chicken mixture, folded, and tied.
