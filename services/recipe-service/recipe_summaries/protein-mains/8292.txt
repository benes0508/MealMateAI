A large whole turkey (12-14 lbs) is prepared using indirect grilling, seasoned with a flavorful rub of toasted fennel, coriander, and black peppercorns. It's cooked over a bed of root vegetables (carrots, celery, parsnips, onion), and served with a rich fresh thyme gravy made from the pan drippings and a dark roux.
