This recipe prepares **Aged Rib Eye with Onion Purée**. It involves making a smooth purée from thinly sliced Vidalia or Maui onions simmered in chicken stock and finished with buttermilk. The aged rib eye steak is seared to develop a deep crust, then roasted to a medium-rare doneness, rested, and finally basted with brown butter before slicing. The dish is served with the warm onion purée, a sprinkle of sea salt, and fresh herbs.
