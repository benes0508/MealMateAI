This "Quick Coq au Vin" recipe features chicken breasts seared with bacon, then warmed in an oven. Mushrooms and shallots are saut√©ed in the bacon drippings, deglazed with red wine and chicken broth, thickened with flour, and seasoned. The sauce, enriched with the bacon and pan juices, is then served over the chicken, garnished with parsley.
