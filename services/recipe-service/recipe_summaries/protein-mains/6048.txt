This recipe details how to make Margarita Pizza. It starts by grilling the pizza dough to achieve grill marks and a set crust, then tops it with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, pecorino romano, salt, and pepper. The pizza is then finished on a cast-iron griddle on the grill or in an oven until bubbly, and finally garnished with fresh basil and extra virgin olive oil.
