This recipe details how to make **Carolina Pulled-Pork Sandwiches**. It involves preparing a dry rub for bone-in pork shoulder, a "cold mop" sauce, and then slow-smoking the pork with hickory wood chips at 225-250Â°F for about 6 hours, basting frequently. Once cooked and shredded, the pulled pork is served on hamburger buns, lightly drizzled with Carolina red barbecue sauce, and topped with tangy coleslaw.
