This recipe is for **Turf Mix**, a savory and crunchy snack mix featuring Chex rice cereal, wasabi peas, various chips (rice, snap pea, coconut), and butter, briefly baked until golden. It's then tossed with a finely ground seasoning blend of SeaSnax (seaweed), garlic powder, lime zest, cayenne, salt, sugar, and dill, offering a unique umami, zesty, and subtly spicy flavor. It can be prepared up to 5 days in advance.
