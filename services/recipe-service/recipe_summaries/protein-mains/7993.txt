This recipe details how to prepare **Chicken Liver Crostini with Pickled Eggs**. It involves pickling hard-boiled eggs and shallots overnight in a sweet and savory vinegar brine. Separately, chicken livers, hearts, and gizzards are gently cooked and then combined with sautéed onions, garlic, fresh thyme, white wine, and ruby port to create a rich paté-like mixture. To serve, the chicken liver mixture is spread onto toasted baguette slices (crostini), then topped with rounds of the pickled egg and shallots, and garnished with fresh thyme.
