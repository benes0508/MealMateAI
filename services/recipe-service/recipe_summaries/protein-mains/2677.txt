This recipe elevates classic grilled cheese using sourdough bread, sharp white cheddar, and thinly sliced shallots. Its unique approach involves pre-draining fresh, ripe beefsteak tomatoes and adding them *after* the sandwich is grilled, preserving their vibrant texture and flavor. Cooked low and slow for a perfectly golden-brown, crispy exterior and melted interior.
