This recipe for Arroz con Pollo features bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs seared until golden, then simmered with basmati rice, sautéed vegetables (onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic), Sazón, saffron, and chicken broth. The dish is cooked until the rice absorbs the liquid and the chicken is done, with an option to broil for crispy chicken skin. It's served garnished with fresh cilantro and parsley, often with plain yogurt, hot sauce, and lime zest on the side.
