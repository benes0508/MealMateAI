This recipe details a slow-roasted black cod dish with a vibrant red chermoula sauce. Black cod fillets are seasoned with salt and pepper, then roasted alongside cherry tomatoes and a flavorful chermoula made from cilantro stems, chile, garlic, olive oil, tomato paste, paprika, red pepper flakes, honey, allspice, and vinegar. The dish is baked until the fish is cooked through and tomatoes are soft. Served warm or at room temperature, it's garnished with fresh cilantro leaves and reserved chermoula.
