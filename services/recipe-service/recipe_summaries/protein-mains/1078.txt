This recipe makes Mexican Meat Patties with Fresh Corn Salsa. It involves processing ground beef and pork with seasonings and cilantro, then rolling the mixture very thin between parchment paper before chilling. A vibrant salsa is made with fresh corn, tomato, red onion, avocado, serrano chile, lime juice, cilantro, salt, and chili powder. The patties are seared until browned and cooked through, then topped with the fresh corn salsa. The patties can be prepared up to two days in advance.
