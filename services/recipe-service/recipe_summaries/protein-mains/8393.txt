This recipe features beef brisket braised in porter beer, resulting in tender, succulent meat. The brisket is first seared, then slow-cooked with aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, sage, and thyme, alongside prunes, dark brown sugar, and bay leaves for a complex, rich flavor. Carrots and mushrooms are added later to the braising liquid. The dish is designed to be made ahead, chilled for up to two days, allowing flavors to meld, and then reheated with its savory pan juices and vegetables.
