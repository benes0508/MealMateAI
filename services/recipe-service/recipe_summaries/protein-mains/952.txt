This vegetarian recipe features roasted pumpkin or butternut squash topped with a homemade dukkha, a flavorful blend of toasted spices (coriander, cumin, nigella, thyme) and seeds (hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, pistachios). The tender roasted squash is garnished with fresh pomegranate seeds, offering a balance of earthy, aromatic, and sweet-tart notes.
