This recipe details making four individual (mini) chicken pot pies. It features a savory filling composed of sautéed onions, baby carrots, and slender green beans simmered in chicken broth, then combined with shredded pre-cooked chicken, crispy bacon, and creamy crème fraîche, all flavored with fresh marjoram. Each pie is topped with a square of flaky puff pastry, brushed with crème fraîche, and baked until golden.
