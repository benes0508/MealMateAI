This recipe details how to make a **Chicken Empanada with Chorizo, Raisins, and Olives**. Whole chicken legs are browned, then simmered in a savory sauce with saut√©ed onions, garlic, bay leaves, chorizo, smoked paprika, green olives, golden raisins, white wine, and chicken broth. Once tender, the chicken is shredded and mixed back into the rich sauce. This flavorful filling is then encased between two layers of thawed frozen pizza dough, sealed, vented, and baked until the crust is golden brown. The empanada is served warm or at room temperature.
