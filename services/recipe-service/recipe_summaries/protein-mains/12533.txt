This recipe is for **Grilled Cornish Hens with Coconut Curry Sauce**. Halved Cornish hens are marinated for 12-24 hours in a homemade coconut red curry sauce, which is prepared by simmering shallots, garlic, ginger, Thai red curry paste, coconut milk, brown sugar, and fish sauce. The marinated hens are then grilled until cooked through, and served with a warmed portion of the reserved curry sauce, garnished with fresh cilantro.
