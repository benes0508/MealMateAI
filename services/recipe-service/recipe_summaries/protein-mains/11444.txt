This recipe features deconstructed holiday turkey pieces (breast, drumsticks, thighs) that are first brined overnight in an aromatic solution with salt, honey, garlic, and herbs. The turkey is then roasted in two stages, initially at 425°F and then 400°F, until golden and cooked through. Finally, a savory sage gravy is made by deglazing the roasting pans, combining the pan juices with chicken broth, and thickening with a butter-flour roux. The carved turkey is served with the homemade gravy.
