This recipe is for **Braised Brisket with Thirty-Six Cloves of Garlic**, a rich and tender beef dish. A beef brisket is first browned, then braised in the oven for 2.5-3 hours with numerous unpeeled garlic cloves, red wine vinegar, chicken broth, thyme, and rosemary until fork-tender. The recipe emphasizes cooling and refrigerating the brisket in its sauce to easily remove fat before slicing and reheating in the prepared, reduced gravy.
