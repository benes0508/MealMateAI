Tacos al Pastor features marinated pork loin and pineapple, grilled until charred, then chopped and combined. The marinade is a blend of pineapple, orange juice, guajillo chile, chipotle adobo, garlic, and spices. The dish is served in warm corn tortillas with a fresh onion-cilantro relish, smoky salsa, and lime wedges.
