Swedish Meatballs are made from ground beef seasoned with onion, allspice, and nutmeg, bound with bread crumbs and egg, then formed into balls and browned. A creamy gravy is prepared in the same pan using a butter-flour roux, chicken broth, and sour cream. The meatballs are returned to the gravy and served, optionally with lingonberry or cranberry sauce.
