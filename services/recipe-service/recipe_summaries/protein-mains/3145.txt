This recipe details how to make **Cheesy Baked Spaghetti Squash Boats with Salami, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, and Spinach**. Spaghetti squash halves are roasted with garlic, then their strands are scraped out and tossed with a creamy sauce made from roasted garlic, cream cheese, and milk, along with salami, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, Parmesan, and mozzarella. This mixture is then stuffed back into the squash shells, topped with more mozzarella, and baked until bubbling and lightly browned. The dish can be assembled a day ahead of baking.
