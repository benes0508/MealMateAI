This recipe is for Mini Beef and Mushroom Patties. It involves finely chopping onions and mushrooms (preferably with a food processor), mixing them with ground beef, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. The mixture is then formed into small patties (about 26) and baked at 450Â°F for 6-7 minutes total. Patties can be made ahead and chilled or frozen.
