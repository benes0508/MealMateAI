This recipe details how to make Double-Fried Chicken Wings, focusing on a two-stage deep-frying process for ultimate crispness. Chicken wings are first seasoned with salt and pepper, then dredged in a flour and cornstarch mixture. They are par-fried at 350°F for 10 minutes, then cooled completely. The wings are then fried a second time at 350°F for another 10 minutes to achieve a super crispy exterior. They can be served plain or tossed with a favorite sauce. An optional step allows for refrigerating the par-fried wings for later second frying.
