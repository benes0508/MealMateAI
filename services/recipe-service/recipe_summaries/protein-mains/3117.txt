This recipe details the preparation of Rosemary Rack of Lamb with Hasselback Roasted Potatoes and Honey-Glazed Carrots for two. A rack of lamb is seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, then roasted alongside thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes basted with a savory miso-paprika butter. Carrots are roasted separately with a sweet honey-coriander glaze. The lamb is cooked to medium-rare, rested, sliced, and served with the tender potatoes and carrots.
