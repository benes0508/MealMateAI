This Noodle-less Zucchini Lasagna offers a lighter, low-carb alternative to the classic. It features layers of a rich, homemade ground beef and tomato sauce, thin grilled zucchini slices replacing traditional pasta, and a creamy mixture of ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses. The dish is assembled and baked until bubbling and golden.
