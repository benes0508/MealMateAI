Grandma Ethel's Brisket with Tzimmes is a braised beef brisket dish. A 6-7 lb brisket is browned, then slow-cooked in the oven with chicken stock and sherry vinegar for 2 hours. Carrots and sweet potatoes are added for another hour, followed by prunes for 30 minutes, until the meat is fork-tender. The dish is cooled, chilled overnight, then sliced and reheated before serving with the tzimmes (carrots, sweet potatoes, and prunes) and sauce.
