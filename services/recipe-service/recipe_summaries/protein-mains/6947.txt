This Ceviche Verde features firm fish marinated in lime juice until opaque, then mixed with a vibrant "verde" blend of diced avocado, tomatillos, green olives, onion, cilantro, and optional jalape√±o. It's finished with olive oil, seasoned with salt, and served fresh with tostadas or tortilla chips.
