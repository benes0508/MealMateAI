This Shoyu Ramen recipe features a rich, savory broth made from slow-simmered pork spareribs, chicken, and aromatics, infused with kombu dashi and bonito flakes. A distinct tare (soy-sake-mirin mixture) is added to the hot broth just before serving. The dish includes tender, thinly sliced pork shoulder (chashu) that's cooked directly in the stock. It's traditionally garnished with jammy soft-boiled eggs, menma (fermented bamboo shoots), fresh scallions, and nori, served over fresh ramen noodles.
