Home-Style Chicken Kebat features boneless chicken thighs marinated in Madras curry powder and fish sauce. The dish is pan-cooked with diced onions and garlic, then simmered until tender. Sliced onions and Roma tomatoes are stirred in briefly at the end for a crisp texture, and it's garnished with fresh cilantro and lime.
