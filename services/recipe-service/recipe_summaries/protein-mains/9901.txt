This recipe details how to prepare "Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream." Chicken breast cubes are marinated with tarragon and lemon, then skewered and broiled until cooked. A separate anchovy cream sauce is made by melting anchovies in olive oil, then combining with crème fraîche, lemon, parmesan, and tarragon. Both the marinated chicken and the sauce can be prepared a day in advance, and the dish can be served warm or cold. Non-lacquered skewers should be pre-soaked if using an oven or grill.
