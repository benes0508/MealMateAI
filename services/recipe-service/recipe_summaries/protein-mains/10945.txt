This recipe for Almond Flan involves caramelizing sugar in a cake pan, then blending blanched slivered almonds, sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, eggs, and Mexican vanilla extract to create a custard. The custard is poured over the hardened caramel, baked in a water bath at 350Â°F for 75 minutes until set, then chilled. To serve, the flan is inverted onto a platter, and any remaining caramel is scraped over it before slicing.
