This recipe describes a Thai-inspired shrimp curry featuring succulent shrimp, crisp yu choy, and tender kabocha squash. It's prepared in a rich coconut milk base, flavored with Thai green curry paste, fresh herbs like basil, cilantro, and kaffir lime, along with lemongrass, fish sauce, and brown sugar. The vegetables are briefly blanched before being added to the simmering curry, which finishes with the shrimp cooking quickly until opaque.
