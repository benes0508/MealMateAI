This recipe for "Macaroni and Eggplant" features fried eggplant slices filled with cooked pasta (perciatelli or bucatini) and topped with a homemade tomato, onion, garlic, and basil sauce. The eggplant is first salted and drained to reduce bitterness, then fried until golden. The pasta is cooked al dente, and strands are cut and rolled inside individual eggplant slices. These rolls are then arranged in a baking dish with the sauce and baked briefly until heated through, typically served with grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
