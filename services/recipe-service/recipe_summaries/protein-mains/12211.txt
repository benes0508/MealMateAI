This recipe is for **Cider-Brined and Glazed Turkey**. It involves brining a whole turkey overnight in an apple cider, salt, allspice, and bay leaf solution. The turkey is then rinsed, dried, and stuffed with a prepared apple sausage and parsnip stuffing. It's roasted at 350°F, periodically brushed with an apple cider and butter glaze, until it reaches 175°F. Finally, a rich gravy is made from the pan drippings, chicken broth, applejack brandy, and cream, to be served alongside the turkey.
