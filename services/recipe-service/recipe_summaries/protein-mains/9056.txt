This recipe details preparing a Chicken Soup featuring asparagus and shiitake mushrooms, uniquely served with homemade **Roasted Fennel Matzo Balls**. The matzo balls are prepared by roasting fennel until tender, pureeing it with seasonings, then combining it with eggs and matzo meal to form a dough that is chilled, rolled into balls, and simmered. These flavorful matzo balls are then added to a simmering chicken broth with sliced shiitake mushrooms and asparagus pieces before serving.
