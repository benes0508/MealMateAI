Shrimp Creole is a flavorful dish featuring shrimp cooked in a rich, tomato-based sauce. The sauce is prepared by saut√©ing a mirepoix of onions, garlic, celery, and bell peppers, then simmering with tomatoes, chicken broth, and spices. Shrimp are added at the end and quickly cooked through, served over rice.
