This recipe features **pan-seared scallops** served over a vibrant **corn mixture with chorizo**. First, corn kernels are cut from the cob and the "milk" is scraped. Chorizo is cooked until crisp, its flavorful oil reserved. Scallions, garlic, and serrano chile are saut√©ed before adding the corn kernels. This corn mixture is then finished with buttermilk and cilantro. Finally, the **sea scallops** are seared in the reserved chorizo oil until a golden crust forms, then basted with butter and finished with lime. The dish is assembled by plating the corn mixture with scallops on top, served with extra lime wedges.
