This recipe details how to prepare **Roasted Ducklings in Orange Sauce**. It involves first par-boiling ducklings with herbs and garlic, then stuffing them with orange and herbs before roasting them on a bed of vegetables and orange slices. The ducklings are basted with orange liqueur and their own rendered fat for a mahogany finish. A rich orange sauce is made from reduced giblet stock, duck fat, flour, orange liqueur, vinegars, orange juice, and marmalade. Finally, the cooked duck pieces are broiled briefly with the sauce to crisp and glaze, then garnished with fresh orange slices.
