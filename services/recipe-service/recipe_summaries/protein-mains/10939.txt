This recipe details how to prepare **Spiced Veal Roulades**. Thinly pounded veal scallops are spread with a parsley-butter mixture, rolled up, secured with toothpicks, and then coated in flour and a spiced egg batter (cinnamon, pepper, cloves, nutmeg). The roulades are pan-fried until browned and cooked through, then sliced and served.
