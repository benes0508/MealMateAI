This recipe details preparing a **Pancetta-Sage Turkey with Pancetta-Sage Gravy**. A 14-16 lb turkey is prepared by spreading a seasoned butter mixture (garlic, pancetta, parmesan, butter, herbs) under the skin and filling the cavity with herb sprigs. It's then roasted at 325°F for about 3 hours until 165-170°F and rested. A savory gravy is made from the pan drippings, browned pancetta, shallots, flour, turkey stock, and white wine, finished with fresh rosemary and sage.
