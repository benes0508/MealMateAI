This recipe details how to make Texas-Style Barbecued Brisket using a beef brisket, a spice rub (salt, chili powder, sugar, pepper, cumin), and hickory or mesquite wood chips. The brisket is dry-rubbed, optionally cured overnight, then slow-smoked on an indirect charcoal grill for 6-8 hours until tender, with regular additions of wood chips and coals. After resting, it's thinly sliced and served with its pan juices, optionally alongside a blended barbecue sauce.
