This Picnic Meat Loaf is a hearty, make-ahead dish featuring a blend of ground pork, chicken, and chopped chicken sausages. Uniquely, it encases whole hard-boiled eggs within the loaf, alongside grated tart apple and onion for flavor. It's baked, then designed to be cooled completely and chilled overnight, making it ideal for serving cold, perfect for picnics.
