This recipe details how to make **Crab-and-Pork Spring Rolls**. It involves soaking and chopping wood ear mushrooms, then combining them with ground pork, jumbo lump crabmeat, egg, cilantro, ginger, scallion, garlic, and salt to create a flavorful filling. Rice paper wrappers are soaked until pliable, filled with the mixture, and tightly rolled. The rolls are then deep-fried in batches until golden brown and cooked through, typically served with nuoc cham dipping sauce.
