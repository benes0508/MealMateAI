This recipe details how to prepare Wine-Braised Brisket with Butternut Squash. Brisket is seared, then braised in a Dutch oven with white wine, diced tomatoes, broth, and onions for 3.5 hours at 300ÂºF. Butternut squash is added for the final hour of cooking. The dish is served with a reduced sauce made from the braising liquid and garnished with fresh herbs, and is noted to be even better the next day.
