"Company Eggs" is a baked breakfast or brunch dish featuring eggs nestled in a creamy, savory base of sautÃ©ed Swiss chard, onion, and garlic. The eggs are topped with sharp white cheddar and baked until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny. The chard and cream mixture can be prepared ahead of time.
