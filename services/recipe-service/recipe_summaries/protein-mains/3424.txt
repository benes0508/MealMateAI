This recipe creates "Roasted-Jalapeno Pimiento Cheese Toasts." It involves roasting and chopping red bell pepper and jalapeno, then mixing them with mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne, paprika, and sharp cheddar to form a spicy pimiento cheese spread. This spread is then applied to lightly toasted ciabatta bread and served with pickles. The pimiento cheese can be made up to 5 days ahead.
