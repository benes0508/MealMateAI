This recipe features **Pistachio-Crusted Chicken** served with **Carrot Raita**. Thin chicken cutlets are marinated in a yogurt-cilantro-garlic mixture, then coated in ground pistachios, pan-fried, and finished in the oven. The accompanying raita is a refreshing blend of pureed carrots, Greek yogurt, cilantro, garlic, and lemon, offering a cool contrast to the savory, crunchy chicken.
