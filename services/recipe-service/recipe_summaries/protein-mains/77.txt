This recipe details how to prepare **Thai Muslim-Style Grilled Chicken (Gai Yang)**. It involves spatchcocking a whole chicken, then marinating it for 12-24 hours in a flavorful blend of aromatics (peppercorns, garlic, cilantro), brown sugar, fish sauce, and spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin, cardamom).

The dish is served with two accompanying elements:
1.  A **sweet and spicy dipping sauce** made from puréed pineapple, vinegar, garlic, jalapeños/serranos, sugar, and spices, cooked until thick.
2.  A **basting liquid** of saffron/turmeric, sugar, salt, and coconut oil.

The chicken is cooked until tender and charred, either on a **grill** (starting with indirect heat, then direct for charring) or **baked in an oven** (low then high heat). It's served with jasmine, coconut, or sticky rice, and topped with fresh cilantro. The recipe also suggests the dhungar method for oven-cooked chicken to impart a smoky flavor.
