This recipe is for a **Curried Beef Stew** with a rich, aromatic, and spicy Thai-inspired flavor profile. It involves making a fresh curry paste from chiles, lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, shallots, garlic, and Thai shrimp paste. Beef chuck is coated in this paste, browned, and then slow-simmered in beef broth for 2-2.5 hours until tender. Carrots, shallots, and kaffir lime leaves are added towards the end, and the stew is garnished with fresh cilantro and Thai basil.
