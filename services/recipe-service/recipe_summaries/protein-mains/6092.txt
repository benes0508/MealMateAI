This recipe features grilled **Pork Tenderloin wrapped in Pancetta** served with a homemade **Plum Chutney**.

The **chutney** is prepared by simmering plums with shallots, brown sugar, sherry or apple cider vinegar, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds, and spices until thick and fragrant. It can be made up to a week in advance.

The **pork tenderloins** are rubbed with a mixture of rosemary, herbes de Provence, and olive oil, seasoned, and then wrapped tightly with thin slices of pancetta (or prosciutto). The tenderloins are grilled until a crisp brown crust forms, then moved to a cooler part of the grill to cook through to 145Â°F. The pork can be prepped one day ahead.

Serve the thinly sliced, rested pork alongside the warm plum chutney.
