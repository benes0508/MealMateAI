Strozzapreti Carbonara with Radishes is a pasta dish featuring strozzapreti or other short pasta, crispy pancetta, and a creamy sauce made from egg yolks, a whole egg, and mixed hard cheeses. Uniquely, it incorporates radishes for a fresh, peppery element. The dish is finished by gently heating the pasta, sauce, and radishes together until the sauce is smooth and coats the pasta.
