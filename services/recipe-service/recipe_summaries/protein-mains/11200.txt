This recipe details **Braised Chicken with Artichokes and Peas**. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are first pan-seared until golden, then braised in a savory sauce made with onions, dry white wine, and chicken broth until tender. Canned artichoke hearts are added to the braising liquid, and frozen baby peas are stirred in at the end for freshness. The dish is finished with fresh parsley.
