This recipe features pre-baked yellow or red beefsteak tomatoes, hollowed out and then stuffed with grilled wild mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, or portobello) that have been marinated in olive oil, shallots, rosemary, and thyme. Layers of fresh Parmesan cheese are alternated with the mushrooms. The stuffed tomatoes are briefly baked again to melt the cheese, then garnished with mixed baby greens and a sweet shallot vinaigrette before serving.
