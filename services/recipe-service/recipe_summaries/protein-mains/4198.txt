This recipe details how to prepare a 14-16 pound **Smoked Turkey with Hot Pepper Jelly Glaze** on a gas or charcoal grill. The turkey is seasoned, then slow-smoked over indirect heat using soaked wood chips (with specific instructions for both grill types) until it reaches an internal temperature of 165Â°F (approx. 12 minutes per pound). While smoking, a glaze is prepared by melting hot pepper jelly with rice vinegar and seasonings. The turkey is brushed with this glaze for the last 15 minutes of cooking, then rested for 20 minutes before carving.
