This recipe for Duck Confit involves a classic two-part process: first, duck legs are salt-cured with herbs and garlic for 24 hours. Then, the rinsed legs are slow-cooked in rendered duck fat at 325°F for 3.5 hours until fall-off-the-bone tender. The confit can be stored chilled, submerged in fat, for up to a month. Before serving, the duck is seared skin-side down and roasted at 400°F to achieve crisp skin.
