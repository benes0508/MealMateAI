This recipe provides instructions for preparing Beef Wellington, where a seared beef tenderloin is coated in Dijon mustard, wrapped in a mushroom duxelles and prosciutto, then encased in puff pastry and baked until golden. The dish is served with a rich green peppercorn sauce made from the pan drippings, crispy roasted fingerling potatoes seasoned with herbs, and assorted winter greens dressed with a warm honey-balsamic vinaigrette and garnished with walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and Parmesan.
