This recipe is for a **Turkey Chowder with Wild Rice, Crimini Mushrooms, and Pancetta**. It involves cooking wild rice separately, browning pancetta and mushrooms, then building a flavorful soup base with saut√©ed carrots, celery, and shallots, thickened with a roux, and simmered with turkey stock and rosemary. Cooked turkey meat, corn, and the previously prepared rice and pancetta are then added, finished with cream, and seasoned. It can be made up to 3 days ahead.
