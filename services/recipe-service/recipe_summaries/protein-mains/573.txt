This recipe for Fried Egg Bánh Mì involves frying eggs until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny, and toasting buttered baguettes. A unique spread is made from mayonnaise and fish sauce. The sandwich is then assembled by spreading the sauce on the baguette halves, topping with fried eggs, seasoned fresh vegetables (cucumber, jalapeños, shredded carrots), cilantro sprigs, and an optional drizzle of Sriracha.
