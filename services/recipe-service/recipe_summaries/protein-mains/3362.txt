This recipe is for a **Chicken & Squash Cacciatore**, an Italian-style stew featuring bone-in chicken thighs, butternut squash (or sweet potatoes), mushrooms, and plum tomatoes. It's enriched with smoked pancetta, aromatics (onion, leek, garlic, rosemary, bay leaves), and red wine, then slow-cooked in the oven until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick. Served with bread for mopping up the sauce.
