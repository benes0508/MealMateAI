This Pretty Easter Pasta Pie (Crostata di tagliolini) is a savory Italian baked dish featuring layers of pre-cooked thin egg noodles, a creamy béchamel sauce, and a rich combination of fillings. These include minced pancetta or prosciutto, tender peas, sautéed mushrooms, and thinly sliced ham. The pie is generously layered with grated Parmesan and diced burrata or mozzarella cheese, then baked in a springform pan until golden. It's designed to be served at room temperature.
