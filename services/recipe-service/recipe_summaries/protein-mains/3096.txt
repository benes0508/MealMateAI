This recipe features beef short ribs braised in a rich, smoky sauce made from rehydrated guajillo, ancho, and morita chiles, then blended with roasted winter squash. Shredded short ribs are rolled into lightly fried white corn tortillas coated in the squash-chile sauce, baked with Oaxaca cheese, and finished with fresh herbs, pumpkin seeds, and onion.
