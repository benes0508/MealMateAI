This recipe details an **Oven Risotto with Kale Pesto**, offering a less labor-intensive approach to the classic dish. The arborio rice is initially started on the stovetop, then largely baked in the oven for minimal stirring, and finished back on the stove for a creamy consistency. A fresh, vibrant pesto is made separately from kale, toasted walnuts, garlic, parsley, and chives. This pesto, along with butter and Parmesan, is stirred into the tender risotto at the end, served topped with more walnuts and cheese.
