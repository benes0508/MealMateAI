This recipe details making delicate dessert pancakes served with a lemon-cinnamon custard, whipped cream, and fresh raspberries. The process involves preparing a thick, strained lemon-cinnamon custard that is then chilled, followed by whisking a thin pancake batter (including Pernod or ouzo) which rests before being cooked into thin, crepe-like pancakes. The warmed, folded pancakes are then garnished with the custard, whipped cream, and raspberries.
