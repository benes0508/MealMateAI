This recipe details how to make Salt and Pepper Shrimp by deep-frying butterflied, shell-on shrimp that have been brined, rinsed, and lightly coated in egg white and a seasoned cornstarch mixture. It also involves separately deep-frying fresh jalape√±o slices and cilantro sprigs, which are then used as a garnish for the crispy shrimp, finished with sea salt.
