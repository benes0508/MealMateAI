This recipe details a Monkfish and Cauliflower Chowder. It involves preparing cauliflower two ways—finely crumbled and as florets—then sautéing leeks and garlic before adding tomatoes and broth. Monkfish (or cod), green olives, and tarragon are simmered in the broth until flavors blend, resulting in a rich, savory chowder typically served with baguette.
