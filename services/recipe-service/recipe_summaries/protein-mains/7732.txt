This recipe details how to make "Frittata Bites with Chard, Sausage, and Feta." It involves wilting and chopping Swiss chard, then sautÃ©ing onion and mild Italian sausage. Eggs are whisked with cream, salt, and pepper, then combined with the cooled chard, sausage mixture, and feta. This mixture is baked in an 8x8-inch dish until set, then cooled, inverted, and cut into 20 pieces. It can be made ahead and reheated, served warm or at room temperature, garnished with fresh parsley.
