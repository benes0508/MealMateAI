This recipe for "Pulled Brisket Sliders" features beef brisket (or boneless short ribs) slow-braised until tender in a rich, homemade sauce. The sauce is prepared from toasted and rehydrated ancho and guajillo chiles, charred tomatoes, garlic, oregano, cumin, and cloves. After searing the meat, it's cooked with the pur√©ed sauce in a Dutch oven for about 3 hours, then shredded and served on mini buns. The brisket can be made ahead.
