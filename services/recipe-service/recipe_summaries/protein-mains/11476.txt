This recipe for Chicken-and-Summer-Squash Kebabs features chicken marinated in a citrus (orange, lemon, lime) and spice (cumin, chili powder) blend, then skewered with red onion, zucchini, and yellow squash. The vegetables are brushed with an oil and balsamic vinegar mixture. The kebabs are grilled until the chicken is cooked through, and served over salad greens with cherry tomatoes.
