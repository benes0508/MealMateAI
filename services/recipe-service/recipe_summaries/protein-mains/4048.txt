Spaghetti Pie is a baked casserole where a "crust" is formed from cooked spaghetti mixed with egg and Parmesan. This is layered in a deep-dish pie plate with a seasoned ground turkey (or beef) marinara sauce, a blend of ricotta and Parmesan cheese with Italian herbs, and topped with mozzarella, then baked until set.
