This recipe details how to prepare Roast Chicken Thighs with Veggies. It involves roasting bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs alongside Brussels sprouts, carrots, sweet potatoes, shallots, and garlic, all tossed with olive oil, rosemary, and salt, at 475Â°F for 30-40 minutes until cooked through and vegetables are browned. An optional broiler finish can achieve extra crispy chicken skin.
