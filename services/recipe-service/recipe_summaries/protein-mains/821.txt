This "Irish Weekend Fry-Up" recipe details how to prepare a traditional full Irish breakfast. It involves pan-frying pork sausages, bacon (rashers), and black/white pudding until golden, then cooking mushrooms and tomatoes (fried or roasted). Eggs are prepared either fried or scrambled, and served alongside buttered toast, with all components arranged together on a warm plate.
