This is a recipe for a **Simple One-Skillet Chicken Alfredo Pasta**. It involves browning chicken pieces, then using the same skillet to simmer penne or ziti in a chicken broth-garlic base. Finally, warm cream, the browned chicken, and Parmesan are stirred in and cooked until the pasta is tender and the sauce is absorbed. Optional add-ins like herbs, mushrooms, or broccoli can be included.
