This recipe is for **Pan-Roasted Pork Chops with Yellow Pepper Mole Sauce**.

The mole sauce is a complex blend made from roasted yellow bell peppers, mango, tomatillos, golden raisins, fried tortillas, pumpkin seeds, onion, and garlic, reduced with chicken broth. Uniquely, it's finished with white chocolate, honey, cloves, and cinnamon. The center-cut bone-in pork chops are pan-seared to golden brown, then finished by roasting in the oven until medium. The dish is served by ladling the warm mole sauce onto plates and topping with a rested pork chop.
