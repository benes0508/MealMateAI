This recipe for "Crispy Chicken with Shallots" focuses on achieving very crispy chicken skin. It involves seasoning chicken with an herb paste (garlic, mint, parsley), chilling it skin-side up for at least 3 hours, then pan-searing skin-side down before roasting with shallots in the oven until done and the skin is exceptionally crisp. Serve with shallots, fresh parsley, and pan juices. The chicken can be prepped with the herb paste a day ahead.
