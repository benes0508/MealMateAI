This Meatloaf recipe combines ground beef chuck and pork with milk-soaked bread crumbs, sautéed onion, garlic, celery, and carrot. Unique additions include finely chopped bacon, prunes, Worcestershire sauce, cider vinegar, and allspice. The mixture is formed into a loaf and baked at 350°F for 1 to 1.25 hours, until it reaches an internal temperature of 155°F, then rested before serving.
