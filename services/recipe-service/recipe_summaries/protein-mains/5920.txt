This recipe details an oven-roasted Chicken Fajitas dish. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are marinated with garlic, lime, chili powder, and cumin, then roasted on a sheet pan with sliced onions, red and green bell peppers, and diced tomatoes with green chiles. The tortillas are warmed in the oven, and the fajita mixture is served wrapped in tortillas with salsa, cilantro, and Greek yogurt, garnished with radishes and lime.
