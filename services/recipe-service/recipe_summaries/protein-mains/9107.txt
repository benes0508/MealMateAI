This "Quick Coq au Vin" recipe is a simplified version of the classic French chicken stew. It involves browning bacon and floured chicken, saut√©ing vegetables (onions, carrots, optional mushrooms, garlic), then simmering everything in red (or white) wine and chicken broth with bay leaf and thyme for 45 minutes until tender.
