Holiday Pork Posole is a rich, make-ahead Mexican stew featuring bone-in pork shoulder braised until fall-apart tender. The pork is then combined with golden hominy and a robust chile base made with ancho chile powder, dried oregano, green chiles, garlic, and cumin. This recipe involves an overnight chilling step for fat removal and flavor development, and is simmered to meld flavors before being garnished with fresh lime, green onion, and cilantro.
