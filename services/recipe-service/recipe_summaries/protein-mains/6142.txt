"The BA Burger Deluxe" is a classic beef burger recipe. It details how to form 4-inch, 3/4-inch thick patties from ground beef chuck, including a thumb indentation to prevent bulging. The burgers are seasoned with salt and pepper, then grilled over medium-hot heat for about 4 minutes per side. American cheese is added during the second side's grilling, and the burgers are served on potato rolls.
