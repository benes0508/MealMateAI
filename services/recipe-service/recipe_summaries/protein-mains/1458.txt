This recipe creates savory Coconut Shrimp Pancakes. A chickpea flour and coconut milk batter forms the base, poured over a skillet-cooked mixture of seasoned shrimp, crispy bacon, and scallions. The pancakes are cooked until golden, then topped with mung bean sprouts, fresh herbs (cilantro, mint, basil), and served with optional chili oil and lime wedges.
