This recipe details how to prepare a **Grilled Porcini-Rubbed Rack of Veal**. It involves making a savory and slightly spicy rub from porcini mushroom powder, red pepper flakes, sugar, kosher salt, and black pepper. The veal is coated with this rub, then grilled in two stages: first, over direct heat to brown, and then over indirect heat until it reaches an internal temperature of 115Â°F. After resting, the loin is separated from the bones, with both parts briefly grilled again for crisping and reheating before the loin is sliced and served.
