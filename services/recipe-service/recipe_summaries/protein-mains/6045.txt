This recipe describes "Pan-fried Hawaiian Pizza," a method for making two individual pizzas using store-bought or homemade dough. The dough is pan-fried until bubbly and browned, then topped with pizza sauce, ham, pineapple, and mozzarella. Each pizza is then briefly broiled to melt the cheese and caramelize the pineapple, finished with fresh basil.
