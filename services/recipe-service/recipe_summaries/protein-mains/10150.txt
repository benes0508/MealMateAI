This recipe features roasted chicken breast with parsnip "fries," served with a simple spicy vinegar sauce. Parsnips are roasted until tender and caramelized alongside pan-seared chicken, which finishes cooking in the oven. The sauce is made by briefly boiling vinegar and red pepper flakes in the chicken drippings.
