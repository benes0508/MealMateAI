This recipe for **Grilled Marinated Eggplant** features grilled eggplant slices dipped in balsamic vinegar, then layered with a flavorful herb mixture of finely chopped parsley, capers, garlic, oregano, and peperoncini in olive oil. The eggplant is grilled dry for a chewy texture and marinated hot to absorb flavor, then served at room temperature after marinating for at least 2 hours.
