Grilled Tandoori Lamb features a boned and butterflied leg of lamb marinated for 3 hours in a homemade tandoori-style spice blend of toasted cumin, fennel, cardamom, black peppercorns, red pepper, fresh ginger, and garlic. It is then grilled for approximately 25 minutes to achieve a medium-rare doneness.
