This recipe details how to prepare a traditional **crawfish boil**. It involves boiling crawfish, potatoes, and corn in a large pot with water, salt, onions, lemons, garlic, and a Louisiana-style crawfish/shrimp/crab boil spice mix. The vegetables are cooked first and removed, then the crawfish are boiled briefly and allowed to soak in the hot, seasoned water for 20-30 minutes before serving alongside the vegetables.
