This recipe details how to make a **Cheesy Chicken Melt With All of the Onions Relish**. It features pan-seared chicken breasts served in a grilled cheese sandwich with rye bread and two types of melting cheese (e.g., Colby Jack, Muenster). The "All of the Onions Relish" is a key component, combining cooked yellow onion with vinegar and chicken drippings, then mixed with fresh red onion, scallions, and fried shallots, offering a complex onion flavor profile. The sandwich is assembled with layers of cheese, the onion relish, and chicken, then grilled in butter until golden and the cheese is melted.
