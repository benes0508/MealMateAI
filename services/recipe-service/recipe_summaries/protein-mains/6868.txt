This recipe for **Swedish Meatballs** involves combining ground beef, ground pork, bacon, saut√©ed onion, and seasonings with a breadcrumb mixture and eggs. The meatballs are then rolled, browned in batches, and finished by simmering in a rich gravy made from beef stock, pan drippings, and flour, with sour cream whisked in at the end for creaminess.
