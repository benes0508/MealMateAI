This recipe details an Asian-inspired twist on classic pigs-in-a-blanket. Pork breakfast sausage pieces are wrapped in flaky puff pastry, flavored with hoisin sauce, fresh scallions, and a hint of Chinese five-spice powder, then brushed with egg wash, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and baked until golden brown and puffed.
