This recipe details a traditional, multi-day preparation for Cassoulet in the Style of Toulouse, a hearty French casserole. It combines dried white beans slow-cooked in a rich ragout with various pork cuts (shoulder, ham hock, pancetta, and pork skin), duck confit, and Toulouse sausages. The extensive process spans three days, involving initial seasoning and soaking, a long simmer of the meats and beans with aromatics and herbs, and a final layered assembly in an earthenware dish, culminating in an extended bake to create a deeply flavorful dish topped with a golden breadcrumb crust.
