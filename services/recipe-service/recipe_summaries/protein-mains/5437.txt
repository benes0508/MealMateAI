This recipe details how to make **Crispy Fish Sticks** using flounder or cod fillets. The fish is breaded by dredging in flour, egg, and panko, then pan-fried in vegetable oil until golden brown (about 3 minutes per side). The breaded fish sticks can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated, or frozen for up to 3 months, and can be cooked from frozen.
