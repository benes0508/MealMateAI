This recipe for Pasta with Chorizo and Chickpeas features a savory sauce made by browning chorizo or hot Italian sausage with shallots, then simmering with tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and chicken broth until thickened. Chickpeas are added to the sauce, and small dried pasta is cooked separately before being combined with the sauce and a little pasta water to create a coated dish. It's served with optional fresh parsley, grated Parmesan, and lemon zest.
