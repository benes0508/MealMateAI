This recipe for "Hoisin-Glazed Meatloaf Sandwiches" creates an Asian-inspired meatloaf with a sweet and savory hoisin glaze, served on toasted bread with a fresh pickled vegetable salad. The meatloaf is made from ground beef and pork, enriched with bacon, bread soaked in chicken broth, scallions, celery, ginger, garlic, and star anise, then baked until tender. A hoisin-ginger-garlic glaze is prepared separately and used both on the meatloaf while baking and brushed onto the toast. The meatloaf slices are pan-fried before assembling the sandwiches, which are garnished with a quick pickled carrot, cucumber, and radish salad and fresh cilantro.
