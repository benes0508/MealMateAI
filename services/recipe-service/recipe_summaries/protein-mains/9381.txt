This recipe details how to make an "Eggnog Flan on Cinnamon Crust." It involves three main components: a spiced cinnamon crust that is pre-baked, a rich eggnog-flavored flan custard baked over a deep amber caramel layer in a water bath, and a rum-infused whipped cream topping. The process includes chilling and baking the crust, preparing the caramel, making and baking the flan until set, chilling it overnight, and finally inverting the flan onto the crust before topping with rum whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.
