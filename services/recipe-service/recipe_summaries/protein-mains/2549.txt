This recipe for Chile-Rubbed Turkey features a flavorful paste made from toasted guajillo, ancho, and arbol chiles, cumin, onion, and garlic. The turkey is first brined for 12-14 hours in a mixture of beer, brown sugar, and a portion of the chile paste. Afterwards, the remaining chile paste is generously rubbed both under and over the turkey skin. The turkey is then roasted until cooked through, basted with butter, and served with a rich pan sauce reduced from the drippings and finished with lime juice.
