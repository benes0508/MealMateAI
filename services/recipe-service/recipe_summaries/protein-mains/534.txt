This recipe details how to make **Chicken Confit with Pickled Tomatoes**, served over a noodle salad. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are marinated with spices, garlic, and thyme, then slow-baked submerged in oil until incredibly tender. The cooked chicken is shredded and crisped in its own flavorful fat. Accompanying this are quick-pickled grape tomatoes with onion and a noodle salad made with rice vermicelli, fresh herbs, and some of the reserved confit fat.
