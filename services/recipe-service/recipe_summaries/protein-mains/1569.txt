Cauliflower Sformati are savory, molded custards made from mashed cauliflower and saut√©ed onions, bound with a thickened chicken stock sauce, ricotta and fontina cheeses, and eggs. The mixture is baked in individual ramekins in a water bath until set and browned. Served at room temperature, they are typically accompanied by a fresh green salad with a lemon-olive oil dressing.
