This is a hearty, one-skillet meal featuring browned Italian and andouille sausages combined with black-eyed peas, Romano beans (or string beans), and grape tomatoes. The vegetables are simmered in chicken broth with onion, garlic, and thyme until tender, then the sausages are added back to heat through, resulting in a flavorful and comforting dish.
