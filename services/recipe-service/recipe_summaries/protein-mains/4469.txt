This recipe details preparing grilled English-style beef short ribs. The ribs are marinated in a citrusy blend of orange and lime juices, olive oil, parsley, and sweet onion for at least 3 hours (or up to a day). They are then grilled using a two-zone method: first searing over direct heat until charred, then finishing over indirect heat to a medium-rare doneness. The rested meat is thinly sliced against the grain and garnished with fresh lemon zest and parsley.
