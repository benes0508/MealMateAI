This recipe features a unique blend of savory and subtly sweet, combining browned mild Italian sausage with a sauce made from cooked red grapes, saut√©ed red onion, garlic, and chicken broth, with a touch of red pepper flakes for warmth. The sauce and sausage are tossed with short-cut pasta (like orecchiette) and finished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs.
