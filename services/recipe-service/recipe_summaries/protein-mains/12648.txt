This recipe details an oven-braised **Sweet-and-Sour Brisket with Shallots and New Potatoes**. A large brisket is first browned, then slowly baked in a rich sauce made from puréed orange juice, dates, garlic, ground cloves, chicken broth, and tomato puree, along with sautéed onions. Shallots and new potatoes are added later during the long baking process until the brisket is tender. The dish is served sliced with the accompanying shallots, potatoes, and sauce.
