This classic Sage Stuffing recipe features sautéed onion and celery combined with cubed baguette, fresh sage, and celery leaves. Enriched with butter, a mixture of turkey stock (or chicken broth) and egg is added to bind the ingredients. The stuffing is then baked at 400°F in a shallow dish, covered initially, then uncovered to achieve a golden, savory side dish.
