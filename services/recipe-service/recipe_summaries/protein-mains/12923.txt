This recipe details preparing a Roast Turkey (16-17 lbs) with Apple Cider Pan Gravy. The turkey is roasted with onions and Granny Smith apples in its cavity, then basted regularly. A flavorful gravy base is made by simmering turkey parts, vegetables, apple cider, and spices, which is later combined with the turkey's pan drippings and reduced for a rich sauce.
