This recipe for Goat Tacos features bone-in goat (shoulder, neck, or leg) slow-braised in the oven until fall-apart tender (3-3.5 hours). The flavorful braising sauce is made from rehydrated guajillo and ancho chiles, tomatoes, garlic, and aromatic spices like oregano, peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves. After braising, the goat is shredded and mixed back into its rich sauce. The tacos are served with warm corn tortillas and traditional toppings such as radishes, crumbled queso fresco, salsa verde, lettuce, cilantro, onion, and lime wedges.
