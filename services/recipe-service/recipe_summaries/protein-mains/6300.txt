Amaretto Olive Oil Cake is a unique baked dessert blending the distinct flavors of amaretto liqueur, olive oil, and finely ground toasted almonds. It uses matzoh cake meal and potato starch as a base, with a light texture achieved by folding meringue into the batter. The cake is baked until golden and served with fresh raspberries.
