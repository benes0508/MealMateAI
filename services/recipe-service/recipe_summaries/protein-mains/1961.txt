This "Grand Aioli" recipe features a classic French garlic mayonnaise (aioli) served alongside an extensive platter of blanched vegetables (potatoes, green beans), hard-boiled eggs, cooked shrimp, and fresh raw vegetables (endive, romaine, radishes, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes). The preparation involves cooking each item separately and chilling, then preparing the aioli in a food processor, and finally arranging everything on a platter for serving. Many components can be prepared in advance.
