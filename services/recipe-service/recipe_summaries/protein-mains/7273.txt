This recipe details how to prepare a hearty Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya, combining applewood smoked bacon, linguiça, andouille sausages, tasso/smoked ham, and chicken thighs with a base of onions, celery, and bell peppers. Spices like paprika, thyme, chili powder, and cayenne, along with diced tomatoes and beef broth, flavor the dish. The preparation involves browning the meats and sautéing vegetables on the stovetop, then adding the other ingredients, including long grain white rice. The jambalaya is brought to a boil, covered, and then baked in the oven until the rice is tender. It's finished with green onions and fresh parsley.
