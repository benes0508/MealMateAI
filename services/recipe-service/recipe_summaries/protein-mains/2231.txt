**Beef Pho:** A traditional Vietnamese soup featuring a rich, aromatic beef broth infused with charred ginger, garlic, shallot, star anise, and cinnamon, seasoned with fish sauce and palm sugar. It's served over thin brown rice noodles and thinly sliced beef, which cooks in the hot broth, and garnished with fresh herbs (Thai basil, Vietnamese mint), bean sprouts, sliced chilies, and onion.
