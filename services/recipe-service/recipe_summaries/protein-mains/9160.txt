These Gorditas are baked cornmeal cups, made from a mixture of creamed corn, cornmeal, butter, and cheese. The mixture is pressed into muffin tins and baked until crisp. They are then served stuffed with various fillings such as shredded meat, beans, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, radish, sour cream, and guacamole.
