This recipe details **Pork Medallions with Mustard-Chive Sauce**. Pork tenderloin slices are sautéed until browned, while a separate sauce is prepared by cooking leeks, reducing chicken broth, white wine, and garlic, then whisking in crème fraîche (or sour cream) and whole grain Dijon mustard. The sauce is thickened, fresh chives and tarragon are added, and the pork is briefly reheated in the sauce before serving, garnished with parsley.
