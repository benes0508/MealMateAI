This Vietnamese Duck Soup features browned duck leg and thigh pieces simmered until tender in a flavorful broth with ginger, onion, fish sauce, and sugar. The shredded duck meat and strained broth are then combined with saut√©ed shallots, tomatoes, and bamboo shoots. The soup is served over rice vermicelli noodles, napa cabbage, and fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, chives), garnished with hot chili sauce and lime wedges. It can be prepared a day in advance.
