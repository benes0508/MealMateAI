This recipe for Herbed Faux-tisserie Chicken and Potatoes involves rubbing a whole chicken with a blend of ground fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, fresh marjoram, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. The chicken is stuffed with lemon, garlic, and herb sprigs, then roasted at 300Â°F for about 3 hours alongside seasoned Yukon Gold potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet, with hourly basting and turning. The dish is complete when the chicken is browned and tender, and the potatoes are golden and soft.
