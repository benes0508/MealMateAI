Egusi Stew is a rich Nigerian dish featuring ground egusi seeds and tender goat meat. Aromatics like onion, garlic, ginger, and Scotch bonnet are sautÃ©ed in palm oil, then egusi seeds are toasted before adding chicken stock, crayfish, Maggi, and iru. Separately seared goat meat is then simmered with the egusi mixture until tender, with pumpkin leaves added near the end. Best served with fufu or pounded yam.
