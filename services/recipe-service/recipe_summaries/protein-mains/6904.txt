This recipe features roasted chicken served with a homemade, fermented hot-sauce butter. The hot sauce is made by pur√©eing and fermenting Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles with bell pepper, orange zest, garlic, St-Germain liqueur, and salt. After fermentation, it's blended with vinegar, strained, thickened with cornstarch, and enriched with butter. Chicken pieces are seasoned, seared in a skillet, and then roasted in the oven until cooked through, served with the warm hot-sauce butter.
