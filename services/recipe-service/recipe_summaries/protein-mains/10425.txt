This recipe details roasting a whole turkey stuffed with Italian sausage and bread stuffing, infused with lemon and oregano butter under the skin and brushed over the exterior. Red onion wedges are roasted alongside. The turkey is cooked at an initial high temperature then lowered, basted regularly, until golden brown and cooked through. Pan drippings are used to prepare a rich gravy.
