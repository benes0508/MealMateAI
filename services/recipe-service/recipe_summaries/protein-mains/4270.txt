This recipe details a Sourdough, Italian Sausage, and Chestnut Stuffing. It involves browning Italian sausage, saut√©ing onions, celery, apple, and garlic, then deglazing with sherry. These ingredients are combined with torn sourdough bread, roasted chestnuts, and moistened with a mixture of eggs and chicken stock. The stuffing is baked in a dish, first covered to heat through, then uncovered to achieve a golden, crisp topping. It can be prepared a day in advance.
