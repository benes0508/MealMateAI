"Mixed Grill with Cherry Cola Barbecue Sauce" is a recipe for a substantial grilled meal featuring baby back pork ribs, chicken breasts, and smoked sausages. The ribs are seasoned with a homemade spice rub and slow-grilled (or smoked) for about 1.5 hours until tender. Chicken and sausages are then added to the grill, and all items are finished, with the ribs basted in a cherry cola barbecue sauce for a sweet and savory glaze. It's served with additional sauce.
