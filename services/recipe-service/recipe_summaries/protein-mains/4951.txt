This recipe features a pork top sirloin roast seasoned with an aromatic rub of crushed fennel seeds, anise seeds, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. It's oven-roasted until deeply browned and reaches an internal temperature of 135Â°F, then rested before slicing. The pork can be seasoned a day in advance.
