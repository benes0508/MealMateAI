This recipe features grilled corn on the cob, elevated by a trio of customizable flavored butters. The butters include a spicy chili blend, a sun-dried tomato and herb combination, and a rich garlic truffle butter. Corn is grilled directly on the cob within its husks for a tender, smoky result, then served with the pre-prepared and softened flavored butters.
