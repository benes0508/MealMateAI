BA's Ultimate Lobster Rolls are a classic featuring fresh lobster meat combined with celery, lemon juice, chives, and mayonnaise. This creamy filling is served in buttered, toasted New England-style hot dog buns. Preparation involves boiling live lobsters, extracting the meat, mixing the simple filling, and toasting the buns.
