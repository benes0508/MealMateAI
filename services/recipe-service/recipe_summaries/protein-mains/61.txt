This recipe details how to make **Fish Tacos al Pastor**, featuring grilled striped bass or halibut marinated in a vibrant adobo of guajillo and morita chiles, achiote, orange, and lime. These are served in warm corn tortillas with a fresh, spicy pineapple-habanero salsa, a smear of reserved chile sauce, and cilantro, finished with a squeeze of lime.
