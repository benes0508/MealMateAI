This recipe is for **Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Rosemary-Orange Dressing**. Boneless chicken breasts are stuffed under the skin with a savory blend of brine-cured green olives, garlic, rosemary, and orange peel. A separate dressing, combining orange juice, rosemary, garlic, olive oil, and olives, is prepared. The chicken and orange wedges are then grilled, basted with the dressing, and served with a reserved portion of the dressing.
