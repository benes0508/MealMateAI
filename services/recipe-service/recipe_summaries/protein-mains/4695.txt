"Crisp Hoi An Pancakes" are savory, crispy Vietnamese crepes made from a turmeric-spiced rice flour batter. They are filled with cooked shrimp, scallions, and mung bean sprouts, then folded into a crisp half-moon shape. These pancakes are served by wrapping wedges in lettuce leaves with fresh herbs and dipping in Nuoc Cham sauce.
