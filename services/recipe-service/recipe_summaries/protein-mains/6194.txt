This recipe is for a **Summer Corn and Cod Chowder**, a hearty soup featuring flaky cod, sweet corn, and diced Yukon Gold potatoes in a creamy, savory broth. It's enriched with bacon, scallions, garlic, and fresh thyme, and finished with half-and-half. The chowder is prepared by first cooking bacon, then building a base with aromatics and flour, simmering with milk and broth, and finally adding the fish and corn. It's garnished with crispy bacon and fresh scallions.
