This recipe prepares bone-in pork chops served with potato-and-cheese-stuffed poblano chiles (Chiles Rellenos) and a rich ancho chile sauce. Poblano chiles are charred, steamed, peeled, and then filled with a mixture of cooked Yukon Gold potatoes, sharp white cheddar, fresh oregano, and toasted cumin. Pork chops are seasoned with ancho chile powder and salt, then grilled alongside the stuffed chiles until cooked through and the cheese is melted. The accompanying sauce is made by simmering chicken broth, orange juice, ancho chile powder, honey, tomato paste, cinnamon, and garlic until reduced. The dish is served with the grilled pork and chiles, drizzled with the re-warmed sauce.
