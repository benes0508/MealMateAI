This recipe is for a Rye, Kale, Mushroom, and Pumpkin Seed Stuffing. It involves toasting pumpkin seeds, saut√©ing mixed mushrooms, celery, shallots, and kale with herbs (sage, rosemary), then combining these with dried rye bread. White wine is deglazed into the mixture, which is then moistened with eggs and chicken stock before being baked in an oven until golden and crisp. It can be prepared a day ahead.
