This recipe is for a **Pork, Vegetable, and Tamarind Stew** featuring slow-simmered pork spareribs or shoulder in a rich, sour broth infused with tamarind pulp, tomatoes, dried shiitake mushrooms, and aromatics. Fresh vegetables like bok choy, eggplant, radishes, and beans are quickly saut√©ed and added at the end for texture. It's a savory, tangy, and hearty stew with a hint of spice.
