Moo-Shu Pork is a traditional Chinese dish featuring thinly sliced pork stir-fried with an aromatic blend of ginger, garlic, and scallions, along with vegetables like napa cabbage, shiitake and black mushrooms, and scrambled eggs. The savory mixture is seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine, and oyster sauce, and traditionally served rolled up in freshly made, thin Chinese pancakes.
