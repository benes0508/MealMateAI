Pan-seared duck breasts are slowly rendered for crispy skin, then seared. They are served with a vibrant, tangy pan sauce made in the same skillet using rendered duck fat, chopped shallots, sherry vinegar, and blood orange segments. The dish is finished with fresh fris√©e and additional blood orange segments for a bright, elegant meal.
