This recipe for "Our Favorite Latkes" details how to make crispy potato pancakes. It involves grating russet potatoes and yellow onions, thoroughly wringing out excess liquid, then mixing them with matzo meal, eggs, salt, and pepper. The latkes are pan-fried in oil (optionally with schmaltz) until golden brown and crisp, then kept warm in the oven. They are traditionally served hot with applesauce or sour cream.
