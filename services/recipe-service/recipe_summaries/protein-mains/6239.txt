This recipe details pan-frying skinless, boneless chicken thighs seasoned with ancho chile powder and cumin. The chicken is chilled for 2 hours to deepen flavor, then cooked in a cast-iron skillet until a crust forms and it's cooked through, finally cut into cubes. It can be prepared a day in advance.
