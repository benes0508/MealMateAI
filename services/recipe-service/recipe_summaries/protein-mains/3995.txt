This recipe details how to make classic French Onion Soup. It involves slowly caramelizing Vidalia onions until deep golden brown, deglazing with dry white wine, then simmering in beef broth with herbs (thyme, bay leaves) until flavorful. The soup is finished with butter and sherry. For serving, garlic-rubbed baguette toasts topped with Gruy√®re cheese are floated on the soup and broiled until the cheese is melted and bubbling.
