This recipe is a creative take on classic Carbonara, featuring deeply charred roasted cauliflower florets alongside crispy bacon. Orecchiette pasta is coated in a rich, creamy sauce made from egg yolks, Parmesan cheese, and bacon fat, emulsified with hot pasta water, then tossed with the roasted cauliflower and fresh parsley.
