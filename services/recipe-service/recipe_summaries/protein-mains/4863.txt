This Tuscan Lasagna is a hearty, layered dish featuring seasoned ground beef, mushrooms, and spinach. It combines low-fat ricotta, part-skim mozzarella, and Parmesan with marinara sauce and whole grain lasagna noodles. Flavored with Italian seasoning, basil, and fennel seeds, it's baked until golden.
