This recipe features boneless, skinless chicken breasts stuffed with a flavorful mixture of fontina cheese, marinated artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, and dried basil. The chicken is seared briefly in an ovenproof skillet and then finished by baking in the oven, resulting in a relatively quick and savory main dish.
