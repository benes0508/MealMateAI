Bo La Lot is a Vietnamese dish featuring grilled ground beef wrapped in blanched Korean sesame leaves. The beef is seasoned with an aromatic blend of shallots, garlic, lemongrass, fish sauce, five-spice powder, and turmeric. The seasoned beef logs are wrapped in the softened leaves, skewered, and then grilled or pan-fried until slightly charred. It's typically served with pickled vegetables.
