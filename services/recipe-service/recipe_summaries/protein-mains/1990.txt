This recipe describes how to make a Tostada-style dish resembling a Memela, featuring a base of rich, re-fried black beans. Lightly toasted corn tortillas are spread with rendered fat, the mashed beans, and crumbled queso fresco, then cooked until warm. The dish is optionally topped with either savory roasted poblano chile strips (Rajas) or a combination of cooked chorizo and fried eggs, served with salsa and additional queso fresco.
