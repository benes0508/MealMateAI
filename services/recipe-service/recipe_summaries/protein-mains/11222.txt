This is a rich and creamy cauliflower soup distinctly flavored with smoked bacon, Pecorino Romano cheese, and a finishing drizzle of truffle oil. The preparation involves saut√©ing bacon and aromatics (onion, celery, garlic), simmering with cauliflower and chicken broth until tender, then pureeing the soup. Heavy cream is stirred in, and it's served with additional cheese shavings and truffle oil. It can be prepared a day in advance.
