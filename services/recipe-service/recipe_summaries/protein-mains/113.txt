This recipe details how to grill a boneless pork shoulder, seasoned with a blend of toasted fennel and oregano, until beautifully browned and crisp. It's then glazed with a sweet and tangy butter-vinegar sauce infused with chiles de Ã¡rbol. The pork is rested, sliced, and served with additional sauce.
