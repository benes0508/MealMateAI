This recipe details how to prepare Memphis-Style Ribs, focusing on an indirect grilling method. Baby back or spareribs are first prepped by removing the membrane, then dry-cured for 4-8 hours with a rub made from paprika, brown sugar, black pepper, and various spices (celery salt, cayenne, garlic powder, dry mustard, cumin). The ribs are smoke-cooked on a grill with hickory wood chips for 1-2 hours until tender, with an optional cider vinegar and mustard mop sauce applied mid-cook, and the remaining dry rub added near the end.
