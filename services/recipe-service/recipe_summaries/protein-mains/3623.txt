This recipe creates Spicy Chipotle Chicken Tostadas featuring tender, simmered chicken thighs shredded and coated in a rich, smoky-spicy sauce. The sauce is made from pur√©ed chipotle chiles in adobo, tomatoes, charred onion, garlic, and a hint of cinnamon and cloves for depth. Optional Mexican chorizo adds extra flavor and texture. These flavorful toppings are served on crispy corn tostada shells (homemade or store-bought), finished with creamy black bean spread, crisp lettuce, fresh onion, crema, queso fresco, and cilantro. The spicy chicken filling can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
