This recipe features grilled pork tenderloin marinated in a tangy, spicy blend of tomato paste, chili powder, and citrus juices. It's served with a vibrant Fire-Roasted Pineapple Salsa, made with pan-browned (fire-roasted) pineapple, red bell pepper, red onion, and fresh basil, offering a fresh counterpoint to the savory grilled pork.
