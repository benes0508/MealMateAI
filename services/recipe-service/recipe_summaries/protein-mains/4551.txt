This recipe details how to prepare **Grilled Rib Eye with Paprika Vinaigrette**. It involves creating a flavorful vinaigrette by infusing oil with paprika, then mixing it with shallots, capers, parsley, and red wine vinegar. Thick bone-in rib eye steaks are seasoned and grilled using a two-zone methodâ€”initially charred over direct heat, then cooked over indirect heat to medium-rare. An optional final step includes caramelizing the grilled steaks with a blend of brown sugar and piment d'Espelette before slicing and serving with the prepared vinaigrette.
