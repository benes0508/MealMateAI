Shrimp in Adobo is a quick and flavorful seafood dish featuring a homemade adobo paste. This rich paste is made from toasted ancho chiles, garlic, apple cider vinegar, oregano, cumin, and a touch of sugar. Peeled and deveined shrimp are coated in the adobo, then quickly broiled until cooked through and slightly browned.
