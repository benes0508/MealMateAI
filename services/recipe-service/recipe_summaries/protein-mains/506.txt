This recipe creates a rich, creamy, and comforting **Cheesy Baked Butternut Squash Polenta** casserole. It involves cooking polenta with finely mashed butternut squash, enriched with whole milk, butter, Parmesan, and a hint of nutmeg. The mixture is then topped with Fontina cheese and crisped sage, chilled overnight (or up to 2 days) for optimal texture, and finally baked until bubbly and golden.
