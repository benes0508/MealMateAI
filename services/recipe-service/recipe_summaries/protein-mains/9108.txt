This recipe is for a **Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo**, a classic Creole/Cajun stew. Key steps include making a dark roux with oil and flour, adding the "holy trinity" of onion, bell pepper, and celery, then simmering with chicken stock. Shrimp, andouille sausage, and okra are added and cooked until tender. It's seasoned with salt, cayenne, and black pepper, and typically served over white rice with hot sauce and fil√© powder.
