This recipe details how to make **Classic Barbecue Pork Ribs** featuring a homemade **Smoky Bacon Barbecue Sauce**.

The process involves first preparing St. Louis style pork spareribs with a flavorful dry rub containing garlic, brown sugar, various spices (smoked paprika, chile powder, cumin, ginger), and herbs. The ribs are then marinated (preferably 12-24 hours in the fridge) and slow-baked until tender.

The unique smoky bacon barbecue sauce is made by rendering bacon, saut√©ing aromatics (onions, garlic, sage, thyme), adding spices, and then simmering with coffee, brown sugar, yellow mustard, Worcestershire, cider vinegar, ketchup, and hot sauce until thickened. Both the ribs (baked) and the sauce can be prepared in advance.

Finally, the baked ribs are finished on a grill (or broiler), basted generously with the homemade sauce until caramelized and lightly charred, then rested and served.
