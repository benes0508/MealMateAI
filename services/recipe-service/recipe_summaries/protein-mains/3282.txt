This recipe details how to make **Silver Dollar Latkes**, small potato pancakes. Key steps involve grating and thoroughly wringing out liquid from russet potatoes and onions, then mixing them with breadcrumbs, an egg, and seasonings. The latkes are then shallow-fried in schmaltz or oil until golden brown, and briefly baked to ensure they are warmed through and re-crisped.
