This recipe describes how to make **Shawarma-Spiced Chicken Pita with Tahini-Yogurt Sauce**. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a blend of cumin, coriander, paprika, cayenne, and cinnamon, then roasted until cooked. Concurrently, a creamy tahini-yogurt sauce is prepared with garlic, lemon zest, and fresh herbs (dill, mint). A fresh salad of cucumber, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onion is also tossed. The dish is assembled by filling warm pitas with the sliced shawarma-spiced chicken and the fresh vegetable salad, then drizzling generously with the tahini-yogurt sauce.
