Miss Ollie's Jerk Chicken is a grilled chicken dish featuring bone-in chicken legs marinated in a spicy, aromatic blend of scotch bonnet chiles, chives, garlic, malt vinegar, soy sauce, Jamaican rum, and warming spices like allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. After marinating, the chicken is grilled using a two-zone heat method, initially searing for char, then slow-cooking until thoroughly cooked and tender.
