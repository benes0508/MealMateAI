This Mediterranean recipe for fish is cooked entirely in the microwave. It features flounder or tilapia fillets cooked with a vibrant medley of green beans, cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives, garlic, white wine, and olive oil. The vegetables are microwaved first to tenderize, then the seasoned fish and fresh thyme are added on top and microwaved until opaque, resulting in a quick, healthy, and flavorful meal.
