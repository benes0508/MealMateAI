This recipe details how to make a **Tomato, Garlic, and Potato Frittata**. It involves whisking eggs with parmesan, basil, salt, and pepper. Garlic, diced potatoes, and halved tomatoes are separately sautÃ©ed until tender and browned. The cooked vegetables are then combined in a skillet, topped with the egg mixture, and cooked on the stovetop before being finished under a broiler with more parmesan until golden and set. The frittata is then cut into wedges and served.
