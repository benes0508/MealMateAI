This recipe details preparing large beets by roasting them whole within a flavorful salt crust made with coarse salt, horseradish, thyme, and orange peel for 1 hour 45 minutes. Once roasted, the beets are peeled, sliced, and served with a zesty horseradish crème fraîche sauce, which can be prepared up to a day in advance.
