"Chicken Spiedies" features chicken chunks marinated extensively (4-24 hours) in a bright, herbaceous, and spicy blend of lemon, vinegar, garlic, mint, dill, soy sauce, and various spices including cardamom and red pepper flakes. The chicken is then skewered and grilled until charred, and served on soft rolls with optional toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, olives, and reserved marinade.
