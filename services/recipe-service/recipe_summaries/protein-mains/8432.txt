This recipe for Chilaquiles Verdes involves making a vibrant salsa verde from boiled tomatillos, chile, onion, and garlic, then blending it with herbs and broth, and simmering to thicken. Corn tortillas are cut into wedges and fried until golden brown to make chips. To finish, beaten eggs are stirred into the hot salsa to thicken it, then the chips are added and gently tossed to absorb the sauce. The dish is topped with Monterey Jack cheese to melt, then garnished with queso fresco, chopped onion, cilantro, and crema fresca before serving immediately.
