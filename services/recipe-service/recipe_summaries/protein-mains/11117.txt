This recipe prepares whole branzino (or sea bass) by roasting it completely encased in a salt crust made from coarse kosher salt and egg whites. The fish is stuffed with herbs and lemon slices before baking. Once cooked and rested, the salt crust is cracked, and the fish is carefully filleted. It's served with a fresh, vibrant salsa of segmented lemon, diced celery, cucumber, capers, olives, and parsley, along with an arugula salad dressed in the salsa's juices.
