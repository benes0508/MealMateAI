This recipe prepares tender pork spareribs coated in a savory miso rub, slow-baked until fork-tender, then glazed and broiled with a rich, spicy-sweet chile-honey sauce featuring gochujang, ginger, garlic, and tamari. The ribs are finished with fresh scallions and optional fried shallots. The sauce and baked ribs can be prepared ahead of time.
