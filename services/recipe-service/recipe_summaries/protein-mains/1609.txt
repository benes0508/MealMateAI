Gia's Mushrooms and Egg is a flavorful, simple dish featuring field and wild mushrooms saut√©ed with garlic in butter and olive oil. An egg is then cracked into the same pan, seasoned with green chile and fresh herbs (rosemary or tarragon), and baked until the whites are set and the yolk cooked to preference. The initial mushroom cooking can be done on the stovetop or directly in the oven.
