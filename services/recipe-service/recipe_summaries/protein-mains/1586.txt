This recipe details how to make a **Make-Ahead Gravy** from scratch. It involves roasting chicken wings and vegetables (onion, carrot, celery) with herbs to create a deeply flavored stock, deglazing with white wine, then simmering. This fortified stock is strained and combined with a butter-flour roux to create a rich, thickened gravy, seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. The gravy can be prepared up to 5 days in advance and reheated before serving.
