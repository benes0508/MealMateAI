This recipe details how to make a rich Seafood Gumbo. It begins by creating a dark roux with bacon fat, oil, and flour, then sautéing a mirepoix of celery, bell pepper, onion, and garlic. These are combined with fish/chicken stock, tomatoes, okra, thyme, bay leaf, and cayenne, and simmered until vegetables are tender. Finally, fresh seafood (shrimp, oysters, crabmeat) and fresh herbs (parsley, scallions) are added and cooked briefly until just done. The gumbo is served hot, often with rice and gumbo filé powder.
