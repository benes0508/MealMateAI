This recipe features roasted Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) served with a vibrant salsa verde. The artichokes are roasted until tender. The salsa verde, made with anchovies, garlic, parsley, capers, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes, offers a pungent, briny, and subtly spicy counterpoint to the earthy vegetables.
