This recipe details how to prepare a robust "Sunday Sauce" featuring braciole (beef rolls stuffed with cheese, breadcrumbs, and herbs), homemade meatballs, and sweet Italian sausages. A rich tomato sauce is made from pureed onions, garlic, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, basil, and spices. The braciole, meatballs, and sausages are each browned separately, then submerged and slow-cooked in the sauce, primarily by baking in a Dutch oven, until all meats are tender. The dish is traditionally served with pasta and topped with Parmesan.
