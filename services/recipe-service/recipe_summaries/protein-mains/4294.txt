This recipe details how to make a rich, deep golden Roasted Poultry Stock. It involves roasting turkey parts (neck, back, giblets, or wings) with onions, carrots, celery, and garlic until caramelized. These roasted ingredients are then simmered with thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and water for about 1.5 hours until reduced, yielding approximately 12 cups of flavorful stock. It can be prepared ahead and chilled for 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.
