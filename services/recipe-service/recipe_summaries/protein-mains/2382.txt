This recipe is for Escargot with Garlic-Parsley Butter. It involves preparing a compound butter with softened European-style butter, fresh garlic, parsley, shallots, dry white wine, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. This butter is piped into escargot shells, a snail is tucked inside, and then topped with more butter. The filled shells are then baked at 450Â°F for 10-15 minutes until sizzling. The shells can be filled and chilled a day in advance.
