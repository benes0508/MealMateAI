Broiled Halibut fillets served with a vibrant Zucchini Salsa Verde. The quick-blended salsa combines zucchini, cilantro, lime juice, white onion, and jalape√±o for a fresh, zesty, and slightly spicy accompaniment. The fish is seasoned with salt, pepper, and coriander before being quickly broiled until opaque.
