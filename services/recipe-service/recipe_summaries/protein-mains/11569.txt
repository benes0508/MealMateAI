This recipe features baked tomatoes, each stuffed with a vibrant pesto made from romaine, parsley, garlic, and Parmesan, along with a cracked egg. Crispy pancetta is cooked separately, and the dish is served over wilted romaine leaves and stems, cooked in the rendered pancetta fat and mixed with the crispy pancetta, then topped with the baked stuffed tomato and additional Parmesan.
