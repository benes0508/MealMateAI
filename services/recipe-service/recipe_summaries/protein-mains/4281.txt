Turkey Posole is a savory stew made with shredded cooked turkey and white hominy in a rich, spiced broth. The broth base is created by blending rehydrated ancho or pasilla chiles with garlic and tomato paste, which is then cooked with saut√©ed onions, turkey stock, and the main ingredients. The stew is simmered to allow flavors to meld and is traditionally served with tortilla chips, avocado, cilantro, and lime wedges.
