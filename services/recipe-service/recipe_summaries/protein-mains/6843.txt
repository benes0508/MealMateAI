This recipe details how to make **Ranch Bison Burgers**. Lean ground bison is mixed with diced sharp cheddar, finely diced jalapeño, lime zest, chili powder, salt, and pepper, then formed into patties. These are grilled until 160°F, topped with grated cheddar during the final cooking stage. The burgers are served on split sourdough rolls, with optional garnishes like red onion, lettuce, pickled jalapeño, and light ranch dressing.
