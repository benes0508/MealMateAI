**Perfect Coddled Egg:** This recipe describes an elegant, simple egg dish cooked in a coddler within a simmering water bath. It combines an egg with heavy cream, ham, and chives, seasoned with salt and pepper. Cooked for about 8 minutes until the whites are set but the yolk remains runny, it's traditionally served with buttered toast.
