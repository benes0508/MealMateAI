This recipe details how to make an "Egg and Gribenes Spread." It involves hard-boiling eggs, saut√©ing diced onion in schmaltz, and then combining these with gribenes, celery, and seasonings (salt, pepper, cayenne, lemon juice, fish sauce). The mixture is then ground, chopped, or mashed to a spreadable consistency, with celery and gribenes folded in at the end.
