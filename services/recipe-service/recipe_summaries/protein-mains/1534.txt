This recipe is for **Filipino-Style Meatloaf (Embutido)**. It's a baked meatloaf made primarily with ground pork, eggs (some boiled and placed inside, others mixed in raw), Parmesan, panko, butter, and unique additions like bread and butter pickles, green olives, and raisins for flavor. The meatloaf is baked until cooked through, then topped with a ketchup and Worcestershire glaze before serving.
