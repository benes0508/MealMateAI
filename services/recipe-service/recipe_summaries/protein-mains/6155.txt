This recipe details how to prepare "Chicken Under a Brick with Avocados and Chiles." A spatchcocked chicken is seasoned, rubbed with oil, lemon zest, and rosemary, then grilled skin-side down under a foil-wrapped brick or cast-iron skillet for crispy skin.

While the chicken rests, poblano chiles, red bell pepper, and red onion are grilled until softened and charred, then tossed with red wine vinegar, saut√©ed garlic, and fresh basil. Finally, halved avocados are seasoned with oil and chili powder, then grilled briefly until warmed. The chicken is served with the grilled vegetables and avocados.
