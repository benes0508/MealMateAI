This recipe features pasta (paccheri or rigatoni) tossed with a vibrant pesto made from fresh ramps (saut√©ed bulbs, blanched greens), pistachios, and Parmesan. Crispy guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl) is cooked separately and then combined with the pasta and pesto, finished with butter and pasta water for a glossy sauce. The dish is garnished with extra Parmesan and pistachios.
