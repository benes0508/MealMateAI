This recipe details a Twice-Baked Butternut Squash, where roasted squash is mashed with a rich parmesan cream, bacon fat, and seasonings, then re-baked in its shell. It's finished with a dollop of airy whipped parmesan cream and a sprinkle of sweet and savory candied bacon and hazelnuts, offering a blend of creamy, savory, and subtly sweet flavors with a delightful crunch.
