This recipe features a creamy winter squash (kabocha/butternut) pur√©e as the base for a carbonara-style pasta dish. It's enriched with crispy pancetta, fresh sage, and Pecorino cheese, served with fettuccine or linguine. The squash and aromatics are simmered in broth, then blended smooth, combined with al dente pasta, and finished with the reserved pancetta and sage.
