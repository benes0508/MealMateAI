This recipe features **Baked Baby Back Pork Ribs** initially seasoned with a chili, garlic, and salt rub. A **Spicy Blackberry Sauce** is prepared by pureeing fresh or frozen blackberries with ketchup, honey, ginger, balsamic vinegar, and hot pepper sauce, then reduced to a thick consistency. The ribs are then glazed with this sweet and spicy sauce and baked further until a rich, caramelized glaze forms.
