This recipe details how to make Duchess Baked Potatoes, a rich side dish. Yukon Gold potatoes are boiled, then riced and gently folded into a mixture of egg yolks, garlic, heavy cream, sour cream, melted butter, salt, and pepper. The mixture is then transferred to a baking dish, decoratively swirled, and baked until golden brown and puffed. It can be prepared a day ahead.
