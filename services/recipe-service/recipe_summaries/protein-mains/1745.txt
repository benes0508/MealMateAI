This recipe features roasted boneless, skinless chicken thighs seasoned with cumin, salt, and pepper. Thin rice noodles are tossed with a prepared "kid friendly" peanut sauce, cilantro, and toasted peanuts. The dish is assembled by arranging the dressed noodles, then adding sections of thinly sliced chicken, cucumbers, carrots, and snap peas, each tossed with a bit more peanut sauce. It's garnished with fresh cilantro, peanuts, and lime wedges, with extra sauce served on the side. Both the sauce and cooked chicken can be prepared ahead of time.
