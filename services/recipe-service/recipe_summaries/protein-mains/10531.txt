This recipe is for **Garlic-Roasted Chicken Breasts** featuring bone-in, skin-on chicken. A flavorful paste of mashed garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes is spread into pockets cut into the breasts and also coats the outside. The chicken is then high-heat roasted at 500Â°F for 20-25 minutes until cooked through.
