Grilled Zucchini and Bell Pepper Fattoush is a fresh and flavorful twist on the classic Middle Eastern bread salad. It features grilled zucchini, bell peppers, and pita bread tossed with cucumber, cherry tomatoes, green onions, Kalamata olives, fresh mint, and cilantro. Finished with feta cheese and dressed in a bright lemon-cumin vinaigrette, it can be optionally garnished with ground sumac.
