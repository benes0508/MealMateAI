This recipe details how to prepare **Fried Chicken with Bacon and Pepper Cream Gravy**. Chicken pieces are marinated in buttermilk, Tabasco, and onion for at least 12 hours, then coated in a spiced flour mixture (paprika, cayenne). After air-drying, the chicken is deep-fried in bacon fat and oil until golden and cooked through. Crispy bacon is prepared separately and kept warm. A creamy pepper gravy is then made from bacon fat, flour, milk, and the reserved bacon bits from the skillet, served alongside the fried chicken and bacon.
