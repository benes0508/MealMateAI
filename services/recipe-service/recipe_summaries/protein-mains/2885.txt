This recipe details **Braised Birria**, a rich and complex dish featuring **bone-in goat or lamb shoulder**. The meat is braised until fork-tender in a vibrant, strained sauce made from rehydrated **ancho chiles**, toasted **peanuts**, aromatic spices (cumin, black peppercorns, garlic powder, cinnamon), and a touch of **Mexican chocolate**. A separate, smooth **tomato-chile sauce** (with chiles de Ã¡rbol and fire-roasted tomatoes) is also prepared. After braising, the meat is briefly roasted to achieve browned edges and served with the tomato-chile sauce, chopped white onion, cilantro, lime wedges, and warm corn tortillas.
