Singaporean Chili Crab is a flavorful Southeast Asian dish starring fresh crab coated in a rich, spicy, sweet, and savory chili sauce. The recipe involves preparing a vibrant sauce from chicken stock, ketchup, chili-garlic sauce, and aromatics. A key step is the humane breakdown and preparation of a live Dungeness or similar crab, which is then dredged in cornstarch and deep-fried until golden. The fried crab is then stir-fried with aromatics and the chili sauce. Finally, eggs are whisked into the remaining sauce to thicken it, which is then poured over the plated crab. Garnished with scallions and cilantro, it's notably served with Buttermilk Beer Beignets.
