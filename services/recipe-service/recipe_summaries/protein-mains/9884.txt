This recipe features broiled skin-on chicken breasts marinated in a tangy and aromatic blend of fresh herbs (parsley, oregano, tarragon), sherry wine vinegar, olive oil, and Dijon mustard. After broiling, a rich pan sauce is made directly on the baking sheet by deglazing with dry white wine or vermouth and finishing with butter.
