This recipe details roasting whole Peking ducks with Yukon gold potatoes, fresh figs, and rosemary. The ducks are scored to render fat, seasoned, and roasted initially with onions and rosemary. Potatoes are then added to the rendered fat, and the ducks continue to roast until done. Finally, figs and remaining rosemary are added to the pan and roasted briefly before serving alongside the duck and potatoes.
