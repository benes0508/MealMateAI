This recipe is for a **Bacon-Wrapped Maple Pork Loin**.

The pork loin is first **brined** in a maple-sage-garlic solution for 8-24 hours. After brining, it's rubbed with a garlic, sage, and maple syrup mixture, then **wrapped in bacon** and roasted at 350°F until it reaches 140°F. A maple-vinegar glaze is then brushed on, and it's roasted further to 150°F. A sauce is made from the pan juices, thickened with cornstarch and flavored with maple syrup. The pork is served sliced with the sauce.
