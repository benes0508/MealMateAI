This recipe details preparing a 6-6.5 lb pork prime rib roast, first brining it for 5 days in a solution of water, salt, sugar, thyme, bay leaves, juniper berries, and peppercorns. After rinsing and a two-hour rest at room temperature, the roast is seasoned with fresh thyme and crushed peppercorns. It's then roasted at 400°F for about 1 hour, or until an internal temperature of 140°F is reached, followed by a 30-minute rest before slicing and serving.
