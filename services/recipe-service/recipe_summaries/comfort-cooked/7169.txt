This recipe details a classic Red Wine Beef Stew. Chuck roast is browned, then slow-braised in a Dutch oven with red wine, chicken broth, tomato paste, onion, bay leaves, and thyme. Carrots and potatoes are added in two stages for tenderness, resulting in a hearty, fork-tender beef stew cooked entirely in the oven.
