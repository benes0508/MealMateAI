Croatian Moussaka is a hearty baked casserole featuring layers of deep-fried potato slices and a rich ground beef and tomato mixture, topped with an egg and cheese custard. The beef filling is sautÃ©ed with onion, garlic, and tomatoes, then combined with cheese and breadcrumbs. Layers of fried potatoes and the beef mixture are assembled in a baking dish, covered with the custard, and baked until golden.
