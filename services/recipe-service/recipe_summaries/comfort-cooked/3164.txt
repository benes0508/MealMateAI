This recipe for **Wild Mushroom Noodle Soup** focuses on creating a rich, savory mushroom broth from rehydrated dried porcini, infused with garlic, thyme, bay, and peppercorns. Egg noodles are cooked separately. Fresh wild mushrooms, carrots, celery, and scallion whites are then simmered in the concentrated broth until tender, before combining with the noodles and scallion greens. The soup is garnished with celery leaves and can be prepared up to 3 days ahead (without noodles).
