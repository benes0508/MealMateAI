A classic baby potato salad featuring tender baby Yukon Gold or red-skinned potatoes. The potatoes are boiled and then tossed warm in a rich, homemade mayonnaise dressing, brightened with white wine vinegar and spicy brown mustard, and finished with fresh chives. The mayonnaise can be prepared a day in advance.
