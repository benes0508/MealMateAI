This recipe details how to make Duck and Shrimp Gumbo. It involves browning duck pieces, preparing a dark roux with flour and duck fat, then saut√©ing a mirepoix (onions, celery, bell peppers). Chicken broth, water, and the browned duck are added and simmered until the duck is tender. The duck is then shredded, fat is skimmed, and shrimp, scallions, and cayenne are stirred in and cooked briefly. The gumbo is served hot over white rice.
