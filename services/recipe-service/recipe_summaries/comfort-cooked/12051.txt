This recipe details how to prepare Braised Lamb Shanks with Coriander, Fennel, and Star Anise. Lamb shanks are seasoned with a toasted, ground blend of coriander, fennel, and peppercorns, then browned. Aromatic vegetables (onion, garlic, celery, carrots, leek) are sautéed in the same pot before Port wine and broths are added and reduced. The browned shanks are returned to the pot with whole cloves, star anise, bay leaves, and crushed red pepper. The dish is then slow-braised in a 350°F oven for about 2 hours until the lamb is tender, served with its rich sauce and vegetables. It can be made up to two days ahead.
