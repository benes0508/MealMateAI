This recipe details a Slow-Cooked Chicken Stew with Kale. It features bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs seared with bacon, then simmered in a Dutch oven with shallots, garlic, white wine, parsley, and bay leaves until very tender. A key element is rendering the chicken skin separately to create a crispy gremolata with garlic, parsley, and lemon zest for topping. The stew is finished with kale and benefits from an overnight chill to enhance flavor before reheating and serving, often garnished with the gremolata and an optional lemon oil dressing.
