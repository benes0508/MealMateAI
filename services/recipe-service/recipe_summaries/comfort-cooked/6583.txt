This recipe is for an Herbed RÃ¶sti Potato Cake, a crispy, golden-brown potato dish. It involves par-boiling and chilling Yukon gold potatoes, then grating and seasoning them with thyme, salt, and pepper. The potato mixture is then pressed into a skillet, pan-fried until the edges are golden, and finished by baking and broiling in the oven to achieve a firm, golden crust, before being inverted and served in wedges.
