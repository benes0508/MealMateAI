This recipe details how to make **Crispy Shaken Potatoes With Rosemary**. Large russet potatoes are boiled until tender-firm, then vigorously shaken in a pot to create a fuzzy surface for extra crispiness. They are then roasted in hot oil until golden brown, with fresh rosemary added halfway through cooking.
