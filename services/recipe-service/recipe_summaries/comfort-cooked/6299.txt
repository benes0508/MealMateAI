This recipe details an Arugula-Stuffed Leg of Lamb, prepared by butterflying a boneless lamb leg, seasoning it with a garlic-oregano-lemon zest paste, and stuffing it with saut√©ed arugula. The lamb is rolled, tied, and roasted at high then lower temperatures until medium-rare. Alongside, a mix of spring vegetables (red onions, potatoes, carrots, and asparagus) are roasted, some added after the lamb to catch drippings. A rich pan sauce is made from the lamb drippings, white wine, and chicken stock. The dish is served with carved lamb, roasted vegetables, and the savory sauce.
