This recipe is for **Shrimp Scallion Dumplings**. It involves creating a filling from finely chopped shrimp, scallions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and salt. This mixture is then wrapped in dumpling wrappers, sealed, and formed into tortellini-like shapes. The dumplings are cooked by simmering in water for about 3 minutes per batch and served warm, typically with Asian-style hot mustard and soy sauce for dipping.
