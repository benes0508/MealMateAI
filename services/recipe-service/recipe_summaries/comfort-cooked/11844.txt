Vietnamese "Pho" Rice Noodle Soup with Beef is a traditional, aromatic noodle soup featuring a rich beef broth simmered with marrow bones, beef chuck, charred ginger and onions, star anise, and cloves. It is served with rice noodles, tender slices of cooked beef chuck, and thinly sliced raw beef sirloin that cooks instantly in the hot broth. The dish is garnished with fresh herbs (cilantro, Asian basil, saw leaf herb), bean sprouts, scallions, sliced raw onions, chilies, and lime wedges, allowing for customized flavor.
