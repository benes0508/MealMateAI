This recipe details how to prepare Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Butter Sauce. A whole beef tenderloin is seasoned, browned, coated with ground porcini mushrooms, and then roasted to a medium-rare doneness. A rich sauce is created by saut√©ing crimini mushrooms, deglazing the roasting pan, and thickening the pan juices with beef stock, black truffle butter, and flour. The sliced tenderloin is served with this savory mushroom-truffle sauce.
