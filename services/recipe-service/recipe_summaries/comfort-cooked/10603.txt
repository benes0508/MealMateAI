Tandoori Chicken is a dish featuring chicken marinated overnight in a blend of nonfat plain yogurt, white vinegar, ginger, garlic, garam masala, cumin, paprika, and tomato paste. The chicken is then high-heat roasted at 500Â°F for about 30 minutes until done, and traditionally served with white rice and other Indian accompaniments like naan bread.
