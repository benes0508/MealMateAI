This recipe features a hearty, saucy mixture of red split lentils and hardy greens (such as spinach, kale, or chard), simmered with aromatic vegetables, garlic, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes. This flavorful lentil and greens mixture is then generously spooned over thick slices of garlic-rubbed, pan-fried country bread, and served with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of paprika, and a lemon wedge.
