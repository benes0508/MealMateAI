This recipe details how to make Grilled Cheese and Short Rib Sandwiches with Pickled Caramelized Onions and Arugula. It features beef short ribs slow-braised in a rich red wine and sherry broth until tender. Sweet and tangy caramelized red onions, pickled with red wine vinegar and sugar, are prepared separately. The sandwiches are assembled with buttered country-style bread, the braised short ribs, cheese, pickled onions, and fresh arugula, then grilled until golden and the cheese is melted. Both the short ribs and pickled onions can be made up to two days ahead.
