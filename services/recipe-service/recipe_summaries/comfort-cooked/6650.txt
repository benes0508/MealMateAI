This recipe for "Faux Pho" is a quick take on the Vietnamese noodle soup, featuring a savory beef broth infused with onion, garlic, ginger, star anise, and cinnamon. Thinly sliced beef eye round is quickly cooked in the hot broth and served over instant ramen noodles, complemented by mushrooms, scallions, and garnished with fresh bean sprouts, basil, and serrano chiles.
