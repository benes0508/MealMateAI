Braised Spiced Pork with Cao Lau Noodles is a Vietnamese-inspired dish featuring slow-braised pork shoulder and belly, marinated in a flavorful blend of shallots, lemongrass, soy sauce, fish sauce, five-spice, and chili paste. The tender pork is served over wide rice noodles and mung bean sprouts, then topped with the rich braising liquid, fresh herbs, lime, sliced chiles, and crispy fried wonton strips.
