This recipe details how to make **Twice-Baked Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Chives**. Russet potatoes are first baked until tender, then the flesh is scooped out and mashed with soft goat cheese, half and half, butter, and fresh chives. This creamy mixture is then spooned back into the potato shells, with some optionally piped for a decorative top, and baked again until heated through and browned. The dish can be prepared a day in advance.
