This recipe for Nach Waxman's Brisket of Beef features a 6-pound beef brisket browned and then slow-cooked in the oven with copious amounts of onions, tomato paste, garlic, and carrot. The brisket is partially cooked, then sliced across the grain and returned to the pot with its juices for a second, longer braise until fork-tender. The dish is noted to be even better the second day.
