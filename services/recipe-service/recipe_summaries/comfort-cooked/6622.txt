This recipe details making Sweet Black Beans (kuro mam√©). It involves an extended soak (8-24 hours) in a baking soda solution, followed by simmering the beans until very tender. A separate sugar syrup is prepared, which the cooked beans are then simmered in during two distinct stages, with cooling periods in between to allow the sweetness to penetrate and flavors to meld. A touch of soy sauce is added in the second simmering to balance the sweetness. The finished beans are stored refrigerated.
