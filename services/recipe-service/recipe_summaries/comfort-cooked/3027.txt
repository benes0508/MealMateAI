This recipe details how to prepare "3-Ingredient Sweet and Savory Short Ribs." English-style bone-in beef short ribs are seared, then braised in a Dutch oven with prune juice and teriyaki sauce until fall-off-the-bone tender. The cooking liquid is then reduced to a flavorful glaze to pour over the ribs.
