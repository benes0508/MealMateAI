This is a recipe for **Broccoli-Cheese Soup**, a creamy, savory soup featuring broccoli florets and sharp cheddar cheese, thickened with a roux of butter and flour, and enriched with milk, half-and-half, and chicken broth. It's seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and traditionally served hot in hollowed-out bread loaves with extra cheese garnish.
