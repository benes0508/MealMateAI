This recipe details how to prepare an Easy Roast Turkey with a flavorful no-roux gravy. The turkey is seasoned with a brown sugar and spice rub, then roasted at high heat before lowering the temperature to finish. The gravy is made by roasting the turkey's neck/giblets and aromatics (onions, celery, garlic) with flour in the pan drippings, then simmering with white wine, chicken broth, and thyme, and finished with soy sauce.
