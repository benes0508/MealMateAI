This recipe details a traditional Filipino Kare-Kare. Oxtails are slow-braised for 6-8 hours with an aromatic sachet (achiote, peppercorns, bay leaves) and vegetables like carrots, celery, and mushrooms until fall-off-the-bone tender. The strained braising liquid is then used to cook additional vegetables, including baby bok choy, Japanese eggplant, and long beans, along with peanut butter. Finally, the shredded oxtail meat is added back. The dish is served topped with peanuts, red chile, and shrimp paste.
