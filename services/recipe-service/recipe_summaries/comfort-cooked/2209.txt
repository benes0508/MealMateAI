This recipe details how to make Oxtail Rag첫 with Semolina Gnocchi. The rag첫 involves browning seasoned oxtails before slow-braising them with vegetables, red wine, and tomatoes for 3-3.5 hours until fall-off-the-bone tender. After chilling overnight, the meat is shredded and returned to the reduced sauce. The semolina gnocchi are prepared by cooking semolina with milk, butter, and Parmesan, chilling until set, then cutting into squares and pan-frying until golden and crisp. Finally, the crispy gnocchi are tossed with the warm oxtail rag첫 and served with fresh parsley and Parmesan. The rag첫 can be made up to two days ahead.
