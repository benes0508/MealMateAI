This recipe details how to make "Flageolets with Autumn Greens and Fresh Bacon." It involves curing fresh bacon briefly, then pressure cooking (or simmering) it with soaked flageolet beans, carrots, onion, garlic, dried apricots, bay leaves, and ancho chile until the beans are creamy. The aromatics are removed, and mixed greens (Tuscan kale, black kale, mustard greens) are folded in and simmered briefly until tender. The dish is seasoned with sherry vinegar, salt, and pepper, and served with crusty bread and olive oil.
