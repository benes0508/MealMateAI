This recipe details how to prepare **Saffron Chicken Broth with Spinach Matzo Balls**. It involves first simmering chicken wings with onions, bay leaves, saffron, and peppercorns to create a rich, saffron-infused broth. Separately, matzo balls are made by combining matzo meal, eggs, spinach, and minced chicken (from the broth's wings) with reserved chicken fat and broth, then chilled, shaped, and simmered until tender. Finally, the matzo balls are added to the reheated saffron chicken broth and served.
