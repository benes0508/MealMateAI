This is an Asian-inspired Short Rib and Vegetable Stew featuring slow-simmered beef short ribs, Korean radish, carrots, potatoes, and dried Chinese black mushrooms. Flavored with soy sauce, fish sauce, Korean hot red pepper paste, molasses, and sesame oil, it offers a rich, savory, slightly sweet, and spicy profile. The preparation involves an initial long simmer and degreasing of the ribs before vegetables and seasonings are added, typically served with brown rice and barley.
