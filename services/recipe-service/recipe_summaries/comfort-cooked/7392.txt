This recipe is for **Candied Sweet Potatoes (Daigaku Imo)**. Japanese sweet potato chunks are gently simmered in a sweet and savory glaze made with sugar, soy sauce, and rice vinegar until tender. The glaze is then reduced to coat the potatoes, which are finally sprinkled with roasted black sesame seeds and served at room temperature.
