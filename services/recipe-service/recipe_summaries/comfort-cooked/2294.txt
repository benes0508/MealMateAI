This recipe is for **Pressure-Cooker Beer-and-Mustard Pulled Turkey**. Bone-in turkey thighs, seasoned with a spice rub (coriander, dry mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder), are pressure-cooked in dark beer until tender. The cooked turkey is then deboned and chopped, while the cooking liquid is reduced and combined with brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, whole grain mustard, and tomato paste to create a rich, tangy sauce. The pulled turkey is then stirred back into the sauce, ready to serve.
