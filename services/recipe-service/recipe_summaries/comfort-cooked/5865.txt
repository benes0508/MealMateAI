Coq au Vin is a classic French chicken stew featuring browned bone-in, skin-on chicken braised in a rich sauce made with red wine, bacon, carrots, celery, onion, tomato paste, and chicken broth, infused with thyme and rosemary. Saut√©ed wild mushrooms are added at the end. The dish is ideal for making ahead of time.
