This recipe details preparing a Miso-Rubbed Turkey with homemade Turkey Gravy. A flavorful rub of miso, butter, onion, and pepper is prepared and massaged under the turkey's skin before roasting at 350°F. The turkey is basted frequently until it reaches 170°F. After resting, the pan drippings are used to create a rich gravy, thickened with a roux of flour and reserved fat, and enriched by deglazing the roasting pan with turkey stock.
