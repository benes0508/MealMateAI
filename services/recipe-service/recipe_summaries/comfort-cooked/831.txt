Maple Meatloaf Muffins are individual baked meatloaves made with ground beef or bison. Diced sweet potatoes are steamed and blended with bacon, thyme, garlic, and maple syrup to form a paste, which is then combined with the meat. The mixture is spooned into muffin cups and baked for 15-20 minutes, offering a savory-sweet, portion-controlled main dish.
