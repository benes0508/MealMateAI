This recipe is for **Coconut-Pandan Jam (Kaya Jam)**. It involves steeping pandan leaves in a mixture of coconut milk and sugar, then slowly whisking in egg yolks and cooking the mixture over a double boiler until it thickens to 180Â°F. The jam is then strained, chilled until set, and can be stored for up to a week.
