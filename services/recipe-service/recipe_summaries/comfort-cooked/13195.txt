This recipe is for Beef Short Ribs in Chipotle and Green Chili Sauce. Beef short ribs are seasoned with a spice blend including cumin, chili powder, and coriander, then chilled. They are then browned in an oven-safe pot, followed by sautéing onions and garlic. Chicken broth, diced tomatoes, lime juice, and chipotle chilies are added, and the ribs are simmered until tender in a 350°F oven for about 1.5 hours. After skimming fat, the sauce is reduced on the stovetop until thickened. Anaheim chilies are added and simmered until soft. The dish is garnished with fresh cilantro and lime wedges.
