A traditional Cajun Shrimp and Tasso Gumbo, this recipe features a homemade shrimp stock and a dark, milk chocolate-colored roux as its base. It incorporates the "holy trinity" (onions, celery, bell pepper), spicy Tasso (Cajun cured smoked pork), okra, and shrimp, simmered until tender. It's typically served with white rice and hot pepper sauce.
