This recipe for Petit Trois's French Onion Soup involves a two-part process to create a rich, traditional version. First, a flavorful veal or beef stock is made from scratch by roasting bones and simmering them with vegetables for about 2 hours. Separately, thinly sliced onions are slowly caramelized for over an hour until golden brown. The caramelized onions are then deglazed with sherry, combined with the homemade stock, and simmered with aromatics for nearly an hour to meld flavors. Finally, the soup is served in bowls, topped with toasted baguette slices and both Gruyere and Emmenthal cheeses, then broiled until bubbly and browned.
