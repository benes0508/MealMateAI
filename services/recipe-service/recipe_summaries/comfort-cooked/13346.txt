This recipe details how to prepare a **Classic Terrine of Foie Gras**. Raw duck or goose foie gras is seasoned with salt and white pepper, layered in a terrine dish with Sauternes, then gently cooked in a low-temperature (200°F) water bath until it reaches an internal temperature of 120-160°F. After baking, the terrine is pressed to remove excess fat, sealed with its rendered fat, and thoroughly chilled for at least one day before being unmolded, sliced, and served, typically with toasted bread.
