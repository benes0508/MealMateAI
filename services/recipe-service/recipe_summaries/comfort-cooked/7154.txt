This "Engagement Chicken" recipe describes roasting a whole chicken seasoned with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, with pricked whole lemons placed inside the cavity. The chicken is roasted, initially at 400°F then at 350°F, until an internal temperature of 180°F is reached. A signature step involves pouring the pan juices, referred to as "marry me juice," over the carved chicken before serving, garnished with fresh herbs and lemon slices.
