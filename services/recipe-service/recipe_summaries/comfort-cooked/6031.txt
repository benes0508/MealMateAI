This recipe details how to make a **Caramelized Onion and Shallot Dip**. It involves roasting thinly sliced onions and shallots with thyme and olive oil until deeply caramelized, deglazing with white wine and sherry vinegar. The cooled, minced onion mixture is then combined with sour cream, fresh chives, Greek yogurt, and onion powder for a savory dip, which can be prepared up to three days in advance.
