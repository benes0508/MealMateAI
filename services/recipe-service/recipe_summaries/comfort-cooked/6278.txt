Eggy Potato Salad with Pickles is a creamy, tangy side dish featuring boiled and coarsely smashed red-skinned potatoes, hard-boiled egg yolks, red onion, and fresh parsley. It's tossed in a mayonnaise-based dressing enhanced with sweet pickle juice and Dijon mustard, seasoned with salt, pepper, sugar, and paprika, and often garnished with a sweet pickle chip.
