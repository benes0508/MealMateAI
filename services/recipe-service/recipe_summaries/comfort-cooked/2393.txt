This recipe details how to make a **Vegetarian Mushroom Gravy** from scratch. It involves creating a flavorful mushroom broth by simmering cremini mushrooms, shallots, and aromatics (garlic, thyme, bay leaves) with vegetable broth, then straining the mixture. A roux is made with flour and oil, to which dry white wine and the strained mushroom broth are added to thicken the gravy. It's seasoned with parsley, salt, and pepper, and can be made up to 3 days in advance.
