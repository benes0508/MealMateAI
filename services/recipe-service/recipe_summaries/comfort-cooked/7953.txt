This recipe details how to prepare a whole roasted chicken, seasoned with mustard and tarragon both inside the cavity and on the skin. After roasting, a rich pan sauce is created from the chicken drippings, thickened with flour, enriched with cream and more mustard, and finished with fresh chopped tarragon, to be served alongside the chicken.
