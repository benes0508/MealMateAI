This recipe details how to prepare **Salt-Roasted Chicken**. A whole chicken is stuffed with herbs (parsley, marjoram, tarragon) and then completely encased in a mixture of kosher salt and egg whites. It's roasted at 400°F for about 70 minutes until it reaches 165°F, resulting in a tender chicken with a crisp salt crust that is discarded before serving.
