This recipe details how to prepare a wet brine for a 12-14 lb turkey. It involves dissolving kosher or sea salt in a gallon of cool water, then submerging the turkey in this brine within a sealed bag placed in a large pan. The turkey should brine in the refrigerator for 8-18 hours, ideally turned periodically, before being removed, dried thoroughly, and brought to room temperature prior to roasting. Note: Do not use a pre-salted kosher turkey.
