This recipe details how to prepare **Braised Brisket with Bourbon-Peach Glaze**. A flat-cut brisket is seasoned with a spice rub (including smoked paprika and cinnamon), seared, then slow-braised for over four hours in a rich liquid of beef broth, stout, bourbon, brown sugar, and vegetables until exceptionally tender. The braising liquid is reduced, and the brisket is finished by being scored, coated with a sweet-savory glaze made from peach jam and bourbon, and broiled for a caramelized crust. It's served sliced with the reduced braising liquid.
