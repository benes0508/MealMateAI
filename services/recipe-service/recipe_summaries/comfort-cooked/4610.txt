This recipe details a **Grilled Potato Salad with Cornichons and Dill**. Yukon Gold potatoes are first boiled until tender, then sliced and grilled until they develop dark brown grill marks and are fully cooked. These grilled potatoes are then tossed with a tangy dressing made from finely chopped cornichons, minced pickled onions, cider vinegar, olive oil, and fresh dill. The salad is seasoned with salt and pepper and served warm or at room temperature.
