This Caramel Chicken recipe features skin-on, bone-in chicken legs and thighs seared until golden and crisp. They are then simmered in a rich, sweet, and savory caramel sauce made by caramelizing brown sugar with rice vinegar, deglazing the pan, and infusing it with garlic, ginger, chicken broth, and soy sauce. The chicken cooks gently until tender, and the sauce is reduced to a thick, glossy coating. Garnished with scallions, it's typically served over white rice.
