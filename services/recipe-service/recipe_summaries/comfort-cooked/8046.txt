Bison and Red Wine Shepherd's Pie is a hearty main course featuring slow-cooked bison (or beef) in a rich red wine sauce with bacon, mirepoix, tomatoes, herbs, parsnips, turnips, and pearl onions. This savory filling is topped with a creamy mashed potato crust, brushed with egg wash and Parmesan, then baked until golden brown and bubbling.
