This hearty "Lentil and Egg Stew" features a rich base of sautÃ©ed onion, fennel, carrots, and garlic with tomato paste, simmered with lentils and Parmesan rind until tender. Wilted spinach is then scattered over, and eggs are gently poached directly in the stew. It's served with crispy garlic-rubbed fried bread, a splash of red wine vinegar, and grated Pecorino cheese.
