This recipe details a Potato, Cheddar, and Chive Soup prepared in a slow cooker. Large potatoes are cooked in chicken stock until tender, then part of them are blended with garlic to a smooth or rustic consistency. This pur√©e is returned to the slow cooker with shredded cheddar, chives, and more stock, then heated. The soup is seasoned with salt and pepper, optionally finished with cream, and garnished with crumbled cheese. A Southwestern variation using cilantro, green chiles, cumin, and coriander is also suggested.
