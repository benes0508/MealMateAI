Sunday Stash Marinara Sauce is a foundational tomato sauce recipe. It involves saut√©ing sweet onions and garlic, adding oregano, then crushed whole peeled tomatoes, salt, and pepper. The sauce is simmered for about an hour until reduced, then blended smooth. It's suitable for making ahead, storing refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 6 months.
