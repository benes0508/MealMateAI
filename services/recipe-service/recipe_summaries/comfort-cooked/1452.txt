This recipe for "Perfect Pot Roast" features a chuck roast seasoned with fennel, salt, and pepper, seared then braised with carrots, onions, garlic, hard cider (or apple cider), beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf in a Dutch oven. The roast cooks in the oven for 3 hours until fork-tender, with vegetables added for the last hour. A rich sauce is made by pureeing and thickening the braising liquid with flour and tomato paste. The dish is served sliced with the vegetables and sauce poured over.
