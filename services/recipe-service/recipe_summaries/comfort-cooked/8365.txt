This recipe details roasting a pre-brined juniper turkey with a blend of aromatics (onion, carrot, celery, garlic, sage, thyme). The turkey is initially roasted breast-side down at 500°F, then flipped breast-side up and roasted at 350°F, basted periodically, until it reaches an internal temperature of 160-165°F. After roasting, the turkey rests for 30-40 minutes before carving. The pan juices are strained, but noted as being too salty for gravy and are instead recommended for making stock later. The dish is served with a separate Chanterelle Mushroom Gravy.
