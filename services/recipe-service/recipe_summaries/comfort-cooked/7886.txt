This recipe details how to roast a whole turkey seasoned with a Grand Marnier-based rub, incorporating dried herbs (basil, oregano, bay leaf), spices (cayenne, paprika, salt), garlic, onions, carrots, and orange slices. The turkey is roasted in white wine at 350Â°F, covered for the first two hours, then uncovered and basted for an additional 1.5 hours, totaling 3.5 hours of roasting time. It's recommended to rest the turkey for 15 minutes before carving.
