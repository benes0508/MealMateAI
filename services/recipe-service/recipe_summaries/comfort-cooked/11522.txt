This recipe is for **Golden Lentil Dip**, a savory spread made by simmering red lentils, onion, celery, and saffron in vegetable stock until tender. The mixture is then blended with butter until it achieves a hummus-like consistency. It's served cool with accompaniments like pretzels, crackers, or vegetables.
