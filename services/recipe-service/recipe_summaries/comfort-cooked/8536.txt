Grilled Herb Potatoes are made by par-boiling sliced Yukon Gold potatoes, then tossing them with a mixture of mixed herbs, smashed garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. The coated potatoes are grilled until tender (about 5 minutes), then returned to the herb oil, tossed again, and finished with a squeeze of lemon.
