This recipe is for a simplified Filipino Chicken Adobo, featuring chicken thighs and drumsticks braised in a savory-tangy sauce of garlic, bay leaves, white vinegar, soy sauce, and brown sugar, with a hint of spice from green chiles. The chicken is first pan-fried to crisp the skin, then simmered in the sauce until tender, and finally coated in the reduced, thickened sauce. It's served over rice, garnished with fresh chiles and black pepper.
