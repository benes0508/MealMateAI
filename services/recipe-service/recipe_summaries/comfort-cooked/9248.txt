This recipe is for Wild Boar Ragù, a rich, slow-cooked Italian meat sauce. Boneless wild boar meat is browned with onion, then simmered for at least two hours in a cast-iron pot with canned tomatoes, red wine, and a robust blend of aromatics including garlic, dried chilies, cinnamon, cloves, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovy paste, and herbs (oregano, basil, sage). The ragù is ready when the meat is exceptionally tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. It's traditionally served over pappardelle or fettuccine pasta, garnished with grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese.
