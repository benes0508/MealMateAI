**Brodo di Parmigiano (Parmesan Broth)**

A savory broth made by simmering Parmigiano Reggiano rinds, aromatic vegetables (onions, potatoes, carrots, garlic), and herbs (bay leaves, thyme, parsley, juniper berries) for 5 hours. Optional Italian sausage can be added for extra flavor. The strained broth can be used immediately, stored refrigerated for 5 days, or frozen for a month. It's versatile for making pasta soups or reducing into a thick sauce for noodles.
