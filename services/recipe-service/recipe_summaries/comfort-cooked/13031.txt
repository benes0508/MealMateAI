Lentils San Stefano is a hearty Italian-inspired lentil and potato stew. It's built on a savory base of rendered pork fat (or bacon), saut√©ed with onion, garlic, and tomatoes, then simmered with pre-soaked lentils until tender and thickened. Finished with fresh basil and oregano, it's traditionally served over or alongside toasted bread.
