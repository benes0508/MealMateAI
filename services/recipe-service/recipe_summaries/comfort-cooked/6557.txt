A rich, slow-simmered **Restorative Beef Broth** made with bone-in beef short ribs, onion, garlic, and a unique touch of prunes. This intensely flavored broth requires approximately 5.5 hours of gentle simmering to achieve its depth. It yields about 8 cups and is ideal for making up to 3 days in advance, with the cooked beef reserved for other uses.
