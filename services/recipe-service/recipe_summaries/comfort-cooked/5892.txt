Scott DeSimon's Lobster Stew is a rich, creamy dish featuring fresh lobster. It's built on a flavorful homemade stock crafted from lobster shells, shallots, brandy, and thyme, with optional lobster roe for added depth. Finished with half-and-half and a touch of Tabasco, it's designed to be prepared a day ahead for optimal flavor melding.
