Creamy mashed potatoes infused with a homemade ranch dressing, featuring buttermilk, mayonnaise, fresh chives, and parsley. The potatoes are boiled, riced for a fluffy texture, then gently folded with warm cream, milk, and butter. A portion of the ranch is incorporated into the potatoes, with extra reserved for drizzling upon serving. This dish can be made ahead and rewarmed in the oven.
