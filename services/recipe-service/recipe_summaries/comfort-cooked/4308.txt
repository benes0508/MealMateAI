This is a rich and creamy seafood chowder featuring haddock or cod, littleneck clams, and cockles in a savory broth made with rendered bacon, aromatic leeks, celery, and garlic. It's thickened with Yukon gold potatoes and finished with heavy cream and fresh thyme. The soup base can be prepared in advance, with the seafood added just before serving, and it's typically garnished with parsley and served with crusty bread.
