"The Fluffiest Mashed Potatoes" is a recipe for exceptionally light and creamy mashed potatoes. It combines russet and Yukon Gold potatoes, which are boiled, drained, and dried for optimal texture. The unique flavor comes from a strained infusion of whole milk, heavy cream, whole black peppercorns, thyme/rosemary, and bay leaves. The cooked potatoes are passed through a food mill with chilled butter and then mixed with the hot, herb-infused cream, seasoned generously with salt and pepper. The recipe also includes instructions for holding the mashed potatoes warm.
