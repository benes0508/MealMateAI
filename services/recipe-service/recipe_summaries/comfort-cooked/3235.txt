This recipe for "Luxe French Potatoes" describes a rich and decadent potato gratin. Yukon Gold potatoes are boiled, then riced and mixed with a creamy garlic, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper sauce. Half of this mixture is combined with Gruy√®re and mozzarella, then spread into a gratin dish. The remaining potato mixture is piped on top in decorative rosettes, and the dish is baked until golden brown.
