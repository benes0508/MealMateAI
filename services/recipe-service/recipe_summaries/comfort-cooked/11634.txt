This recipe details a simple yet elegant preparation for roasted beef tenderloin. A center-cut tenderloin is seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic, then infused with fresh rosemary sprigs. It's pan-seared to brown, then oven-roasted at 350°F until it reaches an internal temperature of 120°F, resulting in a medium-rare finish after resting.
