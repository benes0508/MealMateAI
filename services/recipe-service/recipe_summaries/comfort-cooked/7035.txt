This recipe details how to prepare a rich Shrimp Bisque. It involves creating a flavorful shrimp stock from the shells, sautéing a mirepoix (carrots, celery, onion) with brandy, rice, and tomato paste, then simmering with the stock and herbs. The bisque is then puréed, strained, and finished with heavy cream and lemon juice, with cooked shrimp incorporated and reserved shrimp and chives used as garnish.
