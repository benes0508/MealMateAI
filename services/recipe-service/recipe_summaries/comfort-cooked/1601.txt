This recipe for **Very Classic Dry-Brined Roast Turkey** details a two-stage roasting method. It begins by dry-brining a whole turkey with a mixture of kosher salt and light brown sugar for 12-48 hours. After rinsing, the turkey is initially roasted at 425°F to brown the skin, then the temperature is reduced to 350°F. During the second stage, it's frequently basted with a fragrant butter mixture infused with rosemary, garlic, and soy sauce until the breast reaches 150°F, followed by a resting period before carving.
