This French Potato Salad features a unique, tangy dressing made with chicken broth, white wine, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, olive oil, capers, and green onions. Cooked red-skinned potatoes are sliced while warm and tossed with the dressing. The salad is designed to be served at room temperature after letting the flavors meld for at least an hour; the dressing can also be prepared a day in advance.
