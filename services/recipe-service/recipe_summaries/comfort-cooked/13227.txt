A robust **Roast New York Strip Loin** featuring a flavorful **garlic and herb crust** made with fresh sage and thyme. The boneless beef loin is rubbed with the herb paste and chilled for at least 3 hours (or up to a day) for maximum flavor. It's roasted in a two-stage process (starting at 450°F, then 350°F) until medium-rare to medium doneness, then rested before slicing and serving.
