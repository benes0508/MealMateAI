This recipe details a Buttermilk Cabbage Soup served with a unique Black Walnut "Pesto." The soup features saut√©ed onion and thinly sliced green cabbage simmered in chicken broth, finished with whole fat buttermilk gently warmed to prevent curdling. The accompanying "pesto" is a loose, grainy paste made from toasted black walnuts, apple cider, and salt, served as a central garnish for each bowl.
