This recipe details how to make **Haitian Beef and Pumpkin Soup (Soup Joumou)**, a hearty and flavorful dish. It involves marinating beef (shank and stew cuts) in an Epis seasoning base with lime juice. The beef is then simmered with bones until tender, followed by the addition of calabaza or butternut squash, which is pureed and returned to the pot. Finally, a medley of vegetables (potatoes, carrots, cabbage, onion, celery, leek, turnips), rigatoni pasta, and spices are added and simmered until everything is tender. The soup is finished with a touch of oil, butter, and vinegar, and typically served with crusty bread.
