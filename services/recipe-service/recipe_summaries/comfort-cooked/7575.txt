This recipe details how to make a **Potato Basil Purée**. It involves blanching fresh basil and then puréeing it with a heated mixture of half-and-half and Parmesan cheese. Separately, Yukon Gold or white potatoes are boiled until tender. The mashed potatoes are then combined with the basil-cream purée, salt, and pepper, beaten until smooth, and served hot, optionally garnished with extra Parmesan.
