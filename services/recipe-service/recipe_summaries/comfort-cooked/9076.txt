This recipe features tender lamb shanks slow-braised until fall-off-the-bone in a rich, pureed sauce made with a mirepoix base, tomato paste, chicken broth, and white wine. It's elegantly served with vibrant, individually prepared spring vegetables like baby potatoes, carrots, and sugar snap peas, and brightened by a fresh "spring" gremolata of mint, lemon zest, and garlic, finished with pea tendrils.
