This Smoked-Fish Chowder recipe combines hot smoked trout, bacon, red potatoes, onion, leek, and celery. It's prepared by first crisping bacon and saut√©ing vegetables, then simmering potatoes in clam juice until tender. Smoked trout, buttermilk, and cream are added at the end for a rich, flavorful broth. The chowder can be made up to two days ahead.
