Classic Coq au Vin is a traditional French dish featuring chicken braised in red wine (Burgundy or Pinot Noir). The chicken is first marinated for 1-2 days in wine with vegetables and spices, then browned and slow-cooked in a rich sauce made from the strained marinade liquid and chicken broth. It's finished with crispy bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms, and pearl onions, simmered until tender.
