This recipe details how to make Yaki Onigiri, which are grilled Japanese rice balls. It begins with instructions for preparing Japanese short-grain rice (2 cups rice to 2 cups water yields 4 cups cooked rice). Per serving, 1 cup of hot cooked rice is formed into a compact ball by jiggling it in a bowl, then shaped into a triangle with wet hands. These rice triangles are then grilled over medium heat, requiring careful attention to prevent burning.
