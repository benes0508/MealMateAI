This recipe details how to make Breakfast Tacos featuring homemade chorizo, crispy potatoes, and scrambled eggs. Homemade chorizo is prepared from ground pork, chipotle chiles, and garlic. Russet potatoes are boiled until tender, then pan-fried until golden and crispy. Scrambled eggs are cooked until barely set. The chorizo, potatoes, and eggs are combined and served in warm flour tortillas, topped with cheese, hot sauce, avocado, and cilantro.
