This recipe details how to prepare an Herb-Roasted Turkey, featuring a 12-14 pound turkey seasoned with salt and pepper, then rubbed with a compound butter infused with lemon zest, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The cavity is stuffed with onion, orange, and lemon. The turkey is roasted uncovered, starting at 450°F for 30 minutes, then reducing to 325°F for approximately 2 hours and 3/4, basting frequently, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F in the thigh. A crucial 1-hour resting period after roasting ensures juiciness.
