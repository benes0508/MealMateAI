This recipe details how to prepare an Andouille-Stuffed Pork Loin with Creole Mustard. A boneless pork loin is first brined for two hours, then a cavity is made to stuff it with an Andouille sausage link. The roast is seasoned with a Creole-inspired blend, seared on a hot grill, and then cooked over indirect heat until it reaches 165Â°F. After resting, it's sliced and served with its juices and Creole mustard.
