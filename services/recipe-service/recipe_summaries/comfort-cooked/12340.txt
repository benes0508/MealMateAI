This recipe details how to make Rabbit Étouffée with Baked Cheese Grits. It involves browning rabbit pieces and bacon, then sautéing a mirepoix (onion, carrots, celery) with garlic and herbs. The rabbit and bacon are returned to the pot, deglazed with red wine, then braised with chicken broth and crushed tomatoes in the oven until the rabbit is very tender. It's served alongside baked cheese grits.
