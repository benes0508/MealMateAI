Gramma Pandolfi's Pasta Sauce with Meatballs is a hearty Italian-American dish featuring a rich, slow-simmered tomato sauce loaded with sweet Italian sausage, ground beef, and ground pork. Meatballs, made from a similar blend of meats, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan, are browned separately then finished cooking in the sauce. The dish is served over spaghetti, topped with extra sauce and Parmesan. Both the sauce and meatballs can be prepared ahead and stored.
