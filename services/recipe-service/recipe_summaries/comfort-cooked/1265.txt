This recipe details how to make North African Chicken and Spinach Stew. A whole chicken is first boiled with vegetables (celery, carrots, onion, bay leaves) to create a flavorful stock, and the cooked vegetables are pureed with garlic. Separately, a spinach stew is prepared by simmering this vegetable puree with spinach, butter, and spices (cinnamon, salt, pepper) in some of the reserved chicken stock. Meanwhile, the cooked chicken is deboned, coated in a dry rub of granulated onion, garlic, paprika, cayenne, and oregano, then seared until charred. The dish is served with basmati rice, the spinach stew, and optional lemon wedges.
