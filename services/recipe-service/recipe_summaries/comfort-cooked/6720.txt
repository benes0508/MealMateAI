This recipe outlines how to prepare a smooth pur√©e using boiled celery root, kohlrabi, and potatoes, combined with cooked-down Granny Smith apple. The mixture is passed through a potato ricer, then seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper, and garnished with fresh chervil. It can be made a day ahead and reheated.
