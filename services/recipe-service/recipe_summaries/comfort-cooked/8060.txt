This recipe details a traditional, hearty Brazilian Feijoada, a rich, long-simmered meat stew with black beans. It features an extensive combination of meats, including smoked pork spareribs/chops, slab bacon, ham hock, pig's foot, corned beef, beef chuck, and chorizo. The dish involves pre-soaking beans and corned beef, then slow-simmering the various meats. The black beans are later cooked in the flavorful reserved meat broth, and finally combined with sautéed aromatics like onion, garlic, scallions, and jalapeño, along with the diced and sliced cooked meats for a robust, thickened stew.
