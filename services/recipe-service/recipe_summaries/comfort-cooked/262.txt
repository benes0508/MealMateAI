This Instant Pot recipe creates a Middle Eastern-inspired lentil and rice dish with leeks and spinach. It involves sautéing leeks, then pressure cooking brown or green lentils with spices (cumin, allspice, cayenne, bay leaf, cinnamon stick). Rice is added and pressure cooked, followed by wilting baby spinach. The dish is served warm, garnished with reserved sautéed leeks, salted plain yogurt, and a drizzle of olive oil.
