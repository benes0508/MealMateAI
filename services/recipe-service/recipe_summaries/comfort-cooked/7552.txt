This recipe features slow-braised beef brisket and short ribs, simmered until fork-tender with a fragrant spice sachet. The meats are then glazed with a sweet and tangy horseradish-Dijon sauce and roasted to perfection. It is accompanied by a rich root vegetable mash made from celery root, rutabaga, and Yukon gold potatoes, moistened with the reserved braising liquid. This multi-step dish can be prepared partially in advance.
