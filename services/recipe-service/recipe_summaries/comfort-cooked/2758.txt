This recipe details how to make Chilled Beet Soup (Chlodnik). It involves cooking and grating beets and simmering their greens separately. These are then combined with buttermilk, sour cream, grated cucumbers, pickles, pickle brine, and scallions. The soup is chilled before serving, garnished with hard-boiled eggs and fresh dill. It can be prepared up to two days in advance.
