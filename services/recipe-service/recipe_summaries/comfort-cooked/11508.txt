This is an Italian Caponata, an eggplant-based vegetable stew featuring sautÃ©ed bell peppers, fennel, and garlic, simmered in a tomato and red wine vinegar sauce with Kalamata olives and golden raisins. It's finished with fresh basil and served at room temperature, making it suitable for preparing ahead.
