This recipe features paccheri pasta tossed in a rich, glossy sauce with a variety of seafood, including shrimp, squid, cockles, and mussels. The sauce is built on a base of grated tomatoes, garlic, white wine, and a homemade shrimp stock (made from the shells), finished with a touch of red pepper flakes and fresh basil. The dish involves simmering the shellfish separately before combining all ingredients with al dente pasta for a flavorful and cohesive meal.
