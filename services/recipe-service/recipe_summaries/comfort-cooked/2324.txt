This recipe details a hearty, Mediterranean-inspired stew featuring creamy navy beans, bitter escarole, briny Castelvetrano olives, and tangy feta cheese. Aromatics like garlic, onion, and fennel are simmered with rosemary, lemon zest, and bay leaves, then pre-soaked navy beans are added and cooked until tender. The stew is finished with escarole, fresh basil, and lemon juice, and served with garlic-rubbed toasted country bread, topped with more feta, fresh basil, and red pepper flakes. It can be made ahead of time.
