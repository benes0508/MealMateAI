This recipe details how to prepare a rich Duck Ragù served with creamy polenta. The ragù is made by browning duck pieces, then slow-cooking them with leek, garlic, smoked pancetta, thyme, tomato paste, vinegar, chopped tomatoes, and port until very tender. The duck meat is then shredded and returned to the sauce. The creamy polenta is prepared with milk, instant polenta, butter, whipping cream, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is served by topping the polenta with the duck ragù, garnished with amaranth leaves and extra Parmesan.
