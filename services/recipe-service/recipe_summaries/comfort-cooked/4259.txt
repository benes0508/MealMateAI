This recipe for Rich Turkey Gravy utilizes turkey drippings, stock, and a roux made from the reserved fat and flour. The process involves deglazing the roasting pan with wine or cider, creating a deep golden roux, gradually whisking in the stock and drippings, and adding apple cider vinegar for brightness. Optional additions include soy sauce and fresh herbs; the gravy can also be strained for a smooth texture.
