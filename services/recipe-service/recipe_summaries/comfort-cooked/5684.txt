This recipe is for a **Slow-Roasted Andalusian-Style Lamb and Potatoes**. A bone-in leg of lamb is seasoned with a garlic, thyme, and salt rub, then slow-roasted in a pan with layers of Yukon Gold potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and bay leaves, along with white wine and olive oil. It roasts covered at 350°F for 3-4 hours until very tender, then uncovered at 425°F for 20-25 minutes to brown. The meat is pulled from the bone and served with the roasted vegetables and pan juices.
