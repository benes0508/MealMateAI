Farmhouse Sunday Soup is a hearty soup featuring homemade pasta. The pasta dough, made from flour, egg, and water, is rolled thin and filled with a mixture of shredded cheese, fresh chives/basil, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The filled pasta pieces are then simmered in a savory broth until tender and served with additional cheese.
