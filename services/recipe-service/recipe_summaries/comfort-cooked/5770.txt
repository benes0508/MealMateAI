This recipe details how to make Vinegar-Braised Chicken and Onions. Chicken pieces are browned along with pancetta, cipolline/pearl onions, and garlic. These ingredients are then braised in a flavorful sauce made from balsamic and red wine vinegars, chicken broth, and golden raisins until the chicken is fork-tender.
