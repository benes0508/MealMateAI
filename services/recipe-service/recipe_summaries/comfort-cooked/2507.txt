This recipe details how to make **Braised and Brûléed Apples with Ice Cream**. Large baking apples are gently braised in a flavorful apple cider, maple syrup, butter, and vinegar liquid until tender. The braising liquid is then reduced to a rich caramel sauce. The apple halves are sprinkled with sugar and brûléed with a torch (or broiler) for a crisp, caramelized crust. Finally, the dish is assembled by serving the brûléed apples with vanilla ice cream, drizzled with the warm caramel sauce, and topped with nuts. Apples can be braised a day ahead.
