Brothy Poached Chicken with Mushrooms and Fresh Chile is a light, flavorful soup. Boneless chicken breasts are gently poached with aromatics, creating a savory broth. This broth is then simmered with mushrooms, fresh red chile, ginger, vinegar, and soy sauce. Shredded chicken is added back to warm through, and the soup is served topped with scallions and cilantro. The chicken and broth can be prepared up to two days in advance.
