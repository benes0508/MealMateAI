This recipe details how to make Boiled Peanuts. It involves soaking raw peanuts in the shell (optional but recommended) in a saltwater solution, then simmering them for 6-8 hours (2-3 hours for green peanuts) until very soft like a roasted chestnut, adjusting saltiness as needed. The peanuts are then cooled in the brine before draining and serving or storing.
