This recipe for "No-Knead Bread" involves combining bread flour, salt, yeast, and cool water to form a sticky dough. This dough undergoes a long initial fermentation (12-18 hours) at room temperature. After the first rise, the dough is gently shaped into a round without kneading, then given a second rise (1-2 hours) on a floured towel. The bread is baked in a preheated covered heavy pot at 475Â°F for 30 minutes, then uncovered and baked for an additional 15-30 minutes until deep golden brown. The finished loaf is cooled thoroughly on a rack before slicing.
