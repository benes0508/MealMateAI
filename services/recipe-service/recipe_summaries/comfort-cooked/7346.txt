This recipe details how to prepare Braised Short Ribs with a "Risotto Style" potato and apple side dish. Bone-in beef short ribs are salted and refrigerated for 24 hours, then seared and slow-braised in the oven for over 2.5 hours with a rich liquid containing red wine, tomato purée, chicken stock, and aromatics like onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and apples. The braising liquid is later strained and reduced to create a flavorful sauce.

The accompanying side is made by boiling small-diced Yukon Gold potatoes and Granny Smith apples until tender. These are then simmered with sautéed onions, garlic, white wine, and chicken stock until creamy, similar to a risotto, and finished with Parmesan cheese and lemon juice. The dish is served by plating the potato and apple mixture, topping it with a short rib, and drizzling with the reduced braising liquid.
