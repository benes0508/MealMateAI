Champagne-Poached Pears is an elegant dessert where peeled, firm pears (such as Bosc or Seckel) are gently simmered in a fragrant liquid of champagne (preferably pink), sugar, lemon zest, and optionally rose water or vanilla bean until tender. The pears are then cooled in their poaching liquid and can be served immediately or stored chilled for up to a week.
