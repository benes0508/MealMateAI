Smoked Sausage Jambalaya is a one-pot meal featuring browned pork andouille sausage, saut√©ed green bell peppers, celery, onion, scallions, and garlic. Long-grain white rice, diced tomatoes, and water are added to the pot with the sausage and vegetables, brought to a boil, then simmered until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. The dish finishes with a brief rest before being fluffed.
