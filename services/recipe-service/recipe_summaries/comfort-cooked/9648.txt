This recipe details how to prepare a **Salt and Pepper Crusted Rib Roast**. A 4-rib beef roast is rubbed with olive oil, seasoned generously with kosher salt, and then coated with coarsely crushed mixed peppercorns. It's initially roasted at 450°F for 20 minutes, then the temperature is reduced to 350°F, continuing until the internal temperature reaches 110°F (1.5-2 hours). The roast then rests for 30 minutes, allowing it to reach medium-rare perfection.
