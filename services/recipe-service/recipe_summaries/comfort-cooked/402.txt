This recipe details how to make a flavorful Malaysian Chicken Curry featuring dark meat chicken, marinated overnight in a custom spice blend, then seared and simmered in a thin, milky sauce of coconut milk, whole milk, and sambal badjak with onions and makrut lime leaves. Purple sweet potatoes and carrots are blanched separately and added just before serving. The curry is best served with steamed rice and optionally, buttermilk beer beignets for soaking up the rich sauce. For optimal flavor, marinating the chicken overnight and refrigerating the finished curry overnight before reheating and serving are recommended.
