This recipe details a Smoky Turkey Corn Chowder. It begins by cooking bacon until crisp, then sautéing a medley of vegetables including onion, carrot, bell pepper, and jalapeño. Broth, sweet potato, and green chiles are added and simmered until tender. Finally, shredded turkey or rotisserie chicken, corn, and half-and-half are stirred in, warmed through, and served topped with the reserved crumbled bacon, scallions, and parsley.
