This Shepherd's Pie recipe features a rich, savory lamb and vegetable base topped with creamy mashed potatoes. Boneless lamb shoulder is browned, then braised with pearl onions, leeks, carrots, and turnips in a sauce made with dry white wine, tomato paste, beef broth, and fresh thyme. Once the lamb is tender, the stew is thickened, then covered with a topping of buttery mashed potatoes and broiled until golden.
