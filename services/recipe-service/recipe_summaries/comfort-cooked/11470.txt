This is a Chunky Sweet-Potato Soup, a savory and hearty dish. It features sweet potatoes simmered in broth, with aromatics like caramelized onion, fennel, garlic, and fresh sage. Half of the soup is pureed for a smooth base while retaining chunks, and it's served finished with olive oil and grated Parmesan.
