This recipe features a Double Rack of Pork seasoned with an herb paste (sage, thyme, salt, pepper) and roasted over sliced oranges. The distinctive element is a rich, burnt orange-caramel pan sauce made from caramelized sugar, orange and lemon juices, bourbon, chicken broth, orange marmalade, blanched orange zest, and deglazed pan drippings, finished with orange liqueur. The pork is sliced into individual chops and served with the complex, citrusy sauce and roasted orange slices.
