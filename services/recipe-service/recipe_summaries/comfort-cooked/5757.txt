This recipe for Ditalini with Chickpeas and Garlic-Rosemary Oil creates a hearty, flavorful vegetarian pasta dish. It begins by saut√©ing a finely chopped aromatic base of onion, carrot, celery, whole garlic, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Tomato paste and water are added and reduced, then chickpeas are simmered in the sauce, with a portion pureed to thicken it. Ditalini pasta is cooked separately and combined with the chickpea sauce, using pasta water for desired consistency. The dish is finished with a fragrant garlic-rosemary oil, made by infusing chopped garlic and fresh rosemary in olive oil, drizzled over individual servings.
