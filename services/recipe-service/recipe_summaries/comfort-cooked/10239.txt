Spaghetti alla Puttanesca is a classic Italian pasta dish. It features spaghetti tossed with a quick, savory tomato-based sauce made from saut√©ed garlic, canned tomatoes, Kalamata olives, anchovies, capers, oregano, and crushed red pepper. The dish is finished with fresh Italian parsley and served with grated Parmesan cheese.
