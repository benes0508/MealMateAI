This recipe details how to prepare an Old-Fashioned Ham with Brown Sugar and Mustard Glaze. A 10-pound smoked ham is first baked at 325°F with apple juice, covered, until it reaches 145°F (approx. 3h 45m). After removing the rind and excess fat, the fat is scored, then coated with Dijon mustard, brown sugar, and honey. The ham is then baked uncovered at 375°F for about 30 minutes until well-glazed, with the glaze basted back onto the ham as needed. It's served after resting for at least 45 minutes.
