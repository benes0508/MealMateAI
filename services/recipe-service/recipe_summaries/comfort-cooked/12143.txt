Chicken à la King is a classic, creamy dish featuring poached chicken breast, vibrant bell peppers, and mushrooms. The velvety sauce is prepared with chicken broth, heavy cream, a roux (butter and flour), and egg yolks, flavored with onion, lemon juice, dry sherry, and paprika. The cooked chicken and sautéed vegetables are gently heated through in the sauce, then served over toasted white bread and garnished with fresh parsley.
