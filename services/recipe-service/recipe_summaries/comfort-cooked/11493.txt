This recipe details how to make Red Chileatole, a light cream soup. It features a rich base of puréed ancho chiles, garlic, and onion, thickened with masa harina. The soup is simmered with a variety of fall vegetables including fresh corn (kernels and cob pieces), shiitake mushrooms, green beans or sugar snap peas, and fingerling potatoes, all flavored with epazote. The process involves sautéing aromatics, blending and straining the chile base, then simmering with broth and vegetables until tender. Served with lime wedges.
