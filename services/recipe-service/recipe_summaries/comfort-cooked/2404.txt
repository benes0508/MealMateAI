Mushroom-Thyme Pot Pies are savory individual pies featuring a homemade buttery crust. The rich filling combines various mushrooms (button, crimini, porcini, oyster/maitake), simmered with onion, tomato paste, sherry, and chicken broth to create a complex gravy. Tender fennel and pearl onions are also included, with fresh thyme highlighting the mushroom flavors. The multi-step recipe involves preparing the crust, gravy, and vegetables separately before assembling in ramekins and baking until the pastry is golden brown. Several components can be made in advance.
