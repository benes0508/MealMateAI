Red Pea Bisque with Rum Flambé is a creamy soup featuring kidney beans (red peas) simmered with aromatics (onion, garlic, thyme), chicken broth, and coconut milk until tender. Most of the soup is then puréed, with some whole beans reserved for texture. The bisque is finished with dry sherry and dramatically topped with flambéed dark rum and fresh chives before serving.
