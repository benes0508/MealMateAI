This recipe features creamy, smooth mashed potatoes made from roasted Yukon Gold or German Butterball potatoes, enriched with an infused milk mixture of garlic, thyme, peppercorns, butter, and lemon zest. The dish is topped with "Crispety Cruncheties"â€”a savory, crispy blend of finely chopped garlic, torn country bread, and **kettle-style potato chips**, baked until golden brown with butter, thyme, and smoked paprika, then finished with fresh parsley and lemon zest.
