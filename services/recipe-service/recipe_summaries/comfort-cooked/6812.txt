**Prosciutto-Wrapped Pork Loin with Roasted Apples** is a savory main course featuring a pork loin butterflied, pounded, and filled with a mixture of rehydrated porcini mushrooms, dried apples, saut√©ed onions, garlic, herbs, and ground pork, layered over blanched kale. The stuffed loin is then wrapped in prosciutto, tied, seared, and roasted with fresh apples until tender. It is served sliced with the roasted apples and a rich pan sauce made from deglazed juices, chicken stock, and reserved mushroom liquid.
