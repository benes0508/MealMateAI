Autumn Squash Salad is a layered dish featuring three types of squash: pickled Hubbard, roasted Kabocha, and blanched Delicata. It's combined with fresh Tuscan kale, thinly sliced watermelon radish, and dressed with a cider vinegar, honey, and garlic vinaigrette. The salad is garnished with cured ham, toasted pepitas, and fresh cilantro.
