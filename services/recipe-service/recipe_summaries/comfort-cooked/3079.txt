This recipe details how to make **Fried Potatoes with Tomato-Chipotle Sauce and Aïoli**. It involves preparing three components: crispy, double-fried russet potatoes seasoned with paprika and cumin; a smoky, jammy tomato sauce made with chipotle and pasilla chiles, onions, garlic, and spices; and a homemade garlic aïoli. The potatoes are blanched, chilled, then fried in two stages for optimal crispness, while the tomato sauce is simmered for a rich flavor and then pureed.
