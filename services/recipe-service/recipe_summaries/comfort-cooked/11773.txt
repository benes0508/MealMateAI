This recipe details how to prepare "Pasta with Kielbasa and Swiss Chard." It involves cooking sliced kielbasa until golden, then sautÃ©ing chopped Swiss chard stems and ribs with garlic, followed by the leaves, water, and red pepper flakes. Cooked penne pasta is then combined with the chard-kielbasa mixture and Parmigiano Reggiano, thinning with reserved pasta water as needed.
