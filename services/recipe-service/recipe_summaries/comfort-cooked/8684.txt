A unique take on hot dogs, featuring all-beef hot dogs braised in a cherry or raspberry lambic beer until plump and lightly coated with syrup, then briefly grilled. Sauerkraut is simmered separately with dark beer and brown sugar. Served on grilled buns, topped with the beer-braised sauerkraut, a drizzle of the reserved hot dog beer syrup, and mustard.
