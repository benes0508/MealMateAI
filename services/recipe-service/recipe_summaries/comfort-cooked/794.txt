This is a hearty, plant-based coconut curried vegetable stew. It features a rich blend of carrots, potatoes, cauliflower, green beans, and spinach, simmered in a creamy light coconut milk base. Flavored with onion, garlic, fresh ginger, curry powder, cumin, and turmeric, the stew is naturally thickened by mashing some of the cooked potatoes. It's finished with fresh cilantro and offers optional chili for added heat.
