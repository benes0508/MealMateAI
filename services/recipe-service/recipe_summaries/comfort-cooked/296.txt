Clams Arrabbiata is a spicy, tomato-based seafood dish featuring littleneck clams, pancetta, and ditalini pasta. The sauce is built by saut√©ing pancetta with onion and garlic, then adding hand-crushed tomatoes and red pepper flakes, reducing them to a jammy consistency. Clams are steamed open in the sauce, removed, and then pasta is cooked in the flavorful liquid. Finally, clams are returned to the pot and served with fresh basil and crusty bread.
