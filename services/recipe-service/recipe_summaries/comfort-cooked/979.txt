This recipe details a rich, slow-cooked Oxtail and Red Wine Stew. Oxtails (or beef short ribs) are first browned, then simmered for 3-3.5 hours in a red wine and water broth with leeks, celery, garlic, and tomato paste until fork-tender. A key step involves chilling the stew for at least 12 hours after cooking to develop flavor and allow for easy fat removal. The stew is served with optional homemade accompaniments: a fresh horseradish-beet relish and a crispy herby panko topping. Both the relish and stew can be prepared ahead of time.
