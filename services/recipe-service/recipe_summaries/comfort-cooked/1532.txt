This recipe details an Indian-spiced pork roast with rosemary and onions. It involves toasting and grinding a custom spice blend (peppercorns, fennel, cumin, red pepper flakes, paprika) for an overnight rub on bone-in pork racks. The pork is then roasted on a bed of seasoned onions, initially at a high temperature (500°F) for browning, then at a lower temperature (325°F) until cooked through, resulting in a tender and aromatic main dish.
