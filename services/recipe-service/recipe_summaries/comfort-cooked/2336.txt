Lobster Fra Diavolo is a spicy Italian-American pasta dish featuring fresh lobster. The lobster is seared for flavor, and its meat is later combined with spaghetti. A robust, spicy tomato sauce is built with a sofrito of onions, carrots, and fennel, infused with garlic, Calabrian chiles, red pepper flakes, tomato paste, white wine, and pur√©ed San Marzano tomatoes, with lobster heads simmered in the sauce for added depth. The al dente spaghetti is tossed with the rich sauce, seared lobster meat, butter, and a brandy deglazing liquid, then finished with fresh parsley, lemon juice, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.
