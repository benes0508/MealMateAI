This recipe is for **Oxtail Bourguinonne**, a rich and hearty French-inspired braised dish. It features meaty oxtail pieces browned and then slowly simmered for hours in red Burgundy wine and beef broth with a bouquet garni, bacon, onions, carrots, garlic, mushrooms, and shallots until exceptionally tender. The sauce is then slightly thickened for a comforting, savory meal. It can be prepared a day in advance.
