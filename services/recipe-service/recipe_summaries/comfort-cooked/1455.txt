This recipe for two features a pan-seared, bone-in rib-eye steak cooked to a deep brown crust and medium-rare doneness. It's accompanied by crispy smashed Yukon Gold potatoes, steamed until tender then fried in the rendered steak fat with smoked paprika. A bright, fresh green sauce made with sherry vinegar, finely chopped shallots, parsley, basil, and orange zest completes the dish.
