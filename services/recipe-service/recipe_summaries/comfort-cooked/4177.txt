This recipe details a Horseradish and Parsley Stuffed Rib-Eye Roast. A boneless beef rib-eye is butterflied and filled with a savory mixture of anchovies, garlic, fresh parsley, grated horseradish, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and nutmeg. After being rolled, tied, and chilled, the roast is cooked in a two-stage oven process (initially 400°F, then 300°F) until medium-rare, then rested before slicing.
