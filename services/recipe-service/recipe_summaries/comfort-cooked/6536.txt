This recipe details how to make a Pea Soup with an optional luxurious addition of foie gras. It involves soaking dried yellow peas overnight, then simmering them with diced onion, carrot, celery, and bacon for several hours until very tender. If using, raw foie gras cubes are added directly to warmed bowls and hot soup is ladled over them to gently warm through before serving with a drizzle of olive oil and pepper.
