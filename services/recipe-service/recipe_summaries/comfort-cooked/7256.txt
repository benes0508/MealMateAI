This recipe is for **Pork Loin Spiedino with Pine Nut, Garlic, and Currant Soffritto**. Boneless pork loin cubes are salted and refrigerated for 1-3 days. A unique soffritto is prepared by simmering pine nuts in olive oil until browned, then adding garlic and soaked currants. The pork is skewered, seared on a hot grill, and then finished over indirect heat until medium-well. It's served immediately over arugula, drizzled with the aromatic pine nut, garlic, and currant soffritto.
