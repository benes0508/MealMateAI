This recipe details how to make New England Clam Chowder, starting by cooking bacon and onion, then building a roux with flour and a combination of canned and bottled clam juice. Potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme are simmered in this base until tender. Separately, minced clams are heated with heavy cream. The two components are then combined, seasoned with dry sherry, salt, pepper, Tabasco, and Worcestershire sauce, and served with crackers.
