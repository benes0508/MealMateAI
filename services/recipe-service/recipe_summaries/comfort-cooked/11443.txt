This recipe details slow-roasted whole duck, seasoned and pricked, then roasted for over 4 hours with an initial high heat burst followed by low heat until the skin is crisp. The duck is stuffed with a garlic-fennel confit, shallots, and thyme. A rich, smooth gravy is then created by pur√©eing the pan juices, roasted fennel, and olives with lemon.
