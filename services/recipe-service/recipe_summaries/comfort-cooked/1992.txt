This recipe features crispy crushed potatoes, made from baby Yukon Gold or new potatoes that are boiled, lightly smashed, and then pan-fried until golden brown. They are tossed with a rich, savory "Oyster Bar Butter" flavored with grated garlic, lemon zest and juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and a fresh herb blend of parsley, chives, dill, and tarragon, which melts on the warm potatoes. Elements can be prepared ahead of time.
