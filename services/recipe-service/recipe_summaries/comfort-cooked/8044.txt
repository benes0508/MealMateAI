A hearty and flavorful pork stew featuring tender pork shoulder, pearl onions, and potatoes. Braised in a rich broth with hard apple cider and optional Calvados apple brandy, it includes crispy bacon, aromatic shallots, parsnips, and fresh sage, with Granny Smith apples added for a touch of tartness. Slowly simmered until the pork is fall-apart tender, this stew can be made ahead for convenience.
