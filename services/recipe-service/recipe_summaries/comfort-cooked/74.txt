Doenjang Jjigae is a Korean fermented-soybean stew featuring brisket, soft tofu, onions, zucchini, and Korean chili peppers. The stew is prepared by simmering doenjang, gochujang, and spices in dashi, then adding vegetables, beef, and tofu in stages. It rests before serving, typically with steamed rice and banchan.
