This recipe describes making a hearty Chicken, Vegetable, and Dumpling Soup from scratch. It involves first creating a rich, flavorful broth by simmering chicken wings, chicken breast bones, and various vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, parsnips, leeks, and herbs) for an extended period, then straining and reducing it. A roux is made from rendered chicken fat and flour to thicken the broth. Finally, torn chicken breast pieces, fresh cubed/sliced vegetables, and fresh herb dumplings are added to the thickened broth, along with more fresh herbs, and simmered until heated through.
