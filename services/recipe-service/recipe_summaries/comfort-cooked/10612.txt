This recipe details how to prepare a **Garlic-Roasted Pork Shoulder**. A bone-in, skin-on pork shoulder is heavily seasoned with a paste made from mashed garlic, oregano, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, then marinated for at least 8 hours. It's then slow-roasted in two stages: first covered at 350Â°F for 2.5 hours, then uncovered for another 2-2.5 hours until the meat is fork-tender and the skin is browned and crisp. The pork is served pulled from the bone, accompanied by deglazed pan juices and crispy skin.
