This recipe details a classic **Shrimp Boil**. It involves simmering onions, garlic, lemon, and a rich blend of spices (including bay leaves, various seeds, peppercorns, and cayenne) in water to create an aromatic broth. Shrimp and hot sauce are then added and cooked briefly. The dish is finished by cooling with ice before serving.
