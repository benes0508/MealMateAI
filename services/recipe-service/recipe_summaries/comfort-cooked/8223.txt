This Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie features a savory stew base made with browned seitan, pearl onions, leeks, mushrooms, carrots, and parsnips, all simmered in a rich red wine and vegetable stock sauce. It's topped with a creamy mash of Yukon Gold potatoes and celery root, then broiled until golden brown.
