This recipe features pearl onions that are simmered until tender in a flavorful mixture of ruby port, chicken broth, bay leaves, and brown sugar. The cooking liquid is then reduced to a syrupy glaze, finished with balsamic vinegar, and poured over the onions. Serve warm or at room temperature; can be made up to two days ahead.
