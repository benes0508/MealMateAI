This is a hearty **Ham Hock and White Bean Stew** slow-simmered with smoked ham hocks, white beans, onions, garlic, carrots, and thyme in a white wine-infused broth. The ham meat is shredded and returned to the stew after cooking, and it significantly benefits from an overnight chill to deepen flavors. It's typically served garnished with crispy frizzled shallots and a unique honey-mustard sour cream, with optional cornichons or dill. The stew can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
