This recipe details a rich Red Wine-Braised Short Rib Stew. Boneless short ribs are seared, then braised in a Dutch oven with red wine, beef bone broth, onion, celery, garlic, and thyme for 2.5 hours. Separately, potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms are roasted until tender. Finally, the shredded short ribs and roasted vegetables are combined with the strained braising liquid and garnished with fresh parsley for a hearty, comforting stew.
