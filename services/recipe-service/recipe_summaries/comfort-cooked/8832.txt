Papas a la Huancaína is a classic Peruvian dish featuring boiled, sliced potatoes covered in a rich, smooth, and creamy cheese sauce. The distinctive sauce is made with queso fresco (or feta), milk, onion, garlic, and Peruvian ají amarillo chili paste, then garnished with black olives and lime wedges. It's typically served as an appetizer or side dish.
