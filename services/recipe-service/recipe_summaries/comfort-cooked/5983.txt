This recipe details how to make Turkey and Mushroom Risotto. It involves first simmering turkey stock, then saut√©ing onions and mushrooms. Arborio rice is gradually cooked by adding warm stock in small increments, stirring constantly until creamy and tender. Optional shredded leftover turkey meat can be stirred in to warm through, and the dish is finished with Parmesan, butter, and parsley.
