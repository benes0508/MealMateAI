This recipe details a hearty **Pumpkin Stuffed with Vegetable Stew**. An 8-9 lb pumpkin is prepared and partially roasted with a roasted vegetable and wine sauce. A savory filling is created by roasting an assortment of root vegetables (fennel, parsnips, celery root, carrots, shallots, bell peppers), saut√©ing cremini and chanterelle mushrooms, and seitan (wheat gluten). This mixture, combined with more sauce, is then spooned into the pumpkin, which is roasted until tender. The dish is garnished with fresh herbs (thyme, parsley) and lemon zest, with extra sauce served alongside.
