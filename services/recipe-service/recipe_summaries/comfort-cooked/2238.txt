This recipe details how to make Matzo Ball Soup, featuring a homemade chicken broth and light, fluffy matzo balls. The broth is prepared by simmering chicken pieces with vegetables (celery, carrots, onions, parsnip, turnip), star anise, peppercorns, and dill for several hours, then straining and chilling it. Chicken fat (schmaltz) is reserved from the broth for the matzo balls. The matzo balls are made by combining eggs, chicken fat, and matzo meal, chilling the mixture, then shaping and boiling them until puffed. Finally, the cooked matzo balls are added to the hot, strained chicken soup for serving.
