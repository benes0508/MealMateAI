This recipe details preparing a **Roasted Turkey with Black-Truffle Butter and Cognac Gravy**. A turkey is generously rubbed with a black truffle butter and shallot mixture both under and on the skin, then roasted first at 400°F and then 325°F until cooked through and golden. Concurrently, a rich gravy is prepared by simmering turkey giblets and aromatics to create a stock, which is then combined with deglazed pan drippings (using cognac) and thickened with a butter-flour roux.
