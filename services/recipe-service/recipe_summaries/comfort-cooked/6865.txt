This recipe details how to make a rich, deeply flavored brown chicken stock. It involves first roasting meaty chicken bones until well-browned, then roasting aromatic vegetables (onion, carrots, celery) with tomato paste until similarly browned. Both are then simmered with water, peppercorns, and herbs for 3 hours, strained, and finally reduced to a concentrated 4 cups.
