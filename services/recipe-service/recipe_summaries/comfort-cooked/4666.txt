This is a vegetarian/vegan Sweet Summer Corn Soup. It features fresh corn (kernels and cobs) simmered in vegetable stock with sautéed onions, celery, and potatoes. Spices like thyme, paprika, cayenne, and coriander add depth. A portion of the soup is puréed with soymilk for creaminess, and it's garnished with fresh parsley and charred red bell pepper.
