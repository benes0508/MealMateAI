Holishkes (Stuffed Cabbage) is a traditional dish featuring ground meat and rice stuffing wrapped in blanched cabbage leaves. The stuffing includes beef, rice, onion, and eggs. The unique sweet and sour tomato-based sauce, flavored with citrus (orange and lemon peel), cinnamon, and sugars, is used to braise the tightly rolled cabbage parcels. The dish is simmered for nearly two hours until tender, often served with boiled potatoes and a vegetable.
