This recipe details how to make a **Green Chicken Soup with Dill Matzo Balls**. It involves preparing a **homemade chicken broth** by simmering a whole chicken with various vegetables (celery, carrots, onions, fennel, garlic) and herbs (parsley, dill). Separately, **dill-infused matzo balls** are made from eggs, matzo meal, seltzer, and dill, then gently simmered. Once the broth is ready, the chicken is shredded, vegetables sliced, and added back to the strained broth. Just before serving, **kale** is cooked in the soup, which is then seasoned, and served over the warm matzo balls, garnished with fresh dill and parsley.
