This **One-Pot Gingery Chicken and Rice with Peanut Sauce** is an aromatic, Asian-inspired meal featuring crispy-skinned, bone-in chicken thighs cooked directly with tender basmati rice, shallots, garlic, ginger, and star anise. It's served with a separately prepared creamy, savory-sweet peanut sauce (made with peanut butter, soy sauce, sriracha, vinegar, and honey) and garnished with fresh cucumber and cilantro for a complete, flavorful dish. The sauce can be made ahead for added convenience.
