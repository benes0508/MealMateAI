Spicy Feel-Good Chicken Soup is a comforting and warming dish featuring spicy chicken stock, kabocha squash, mixed cabbages, and cooked chicken. The soup is simmered until the squash is tender, then seasoned and served with fresh jalape√±o, basil, cilantro, a drizzle of chili oil, grated ginger, and lime wedges. It can be prepared ahead of time.
