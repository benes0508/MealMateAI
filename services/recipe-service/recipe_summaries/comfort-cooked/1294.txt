This recipe is for **Party Posole Rojo**, a hearty, slow-cooked Mexican-inspired stew featuring dried white hominy and bone-in country-style pork ribs. The dish develops its rich, savory flavor from a vibrant purée of New Mexico and ancho chiles, onions, garlic, vinegar, and brown sugar. The hominy is simmered until tender alongside the pork, which is then shredded and returned to the pot with the chile purée. It's served with a variety of fresh toppings like avocado, cilantro, cabbage, jalapeños, radishes, and lime wedges, plus sour cream, tortilla chips, and hot sauce. It can be prepared up to 4 days in advance.
