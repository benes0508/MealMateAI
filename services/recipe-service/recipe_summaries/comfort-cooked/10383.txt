This is a creamy chowder featuring parsnips, yams (sweet potato), and fresh watercress. It's prepared by saut√©ing parsnips and onion in butter, simmering them with apple and chicken broth, then pureeing a portion for thickness. Yam cubes are then added and cooked until tender, and the chowder is finished with cream and wilted watercress.
