Potato and Pea Salad with Chive Aïoli is a chilled side dish featuring tender red-skinned new potatoes, peas, and celery, tossed in a creamy, savory aïoli made with mayonnaise, fresh chives, Dijon mustard, garlic, and a touch of cayenne. It requires chilling for flavors to meld and can be prepared up to a day in advance.
