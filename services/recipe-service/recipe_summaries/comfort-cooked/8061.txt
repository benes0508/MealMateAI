This Borscht recipe describes a hearty, traditional soup featuring a base of beef, chicken, or vegetable broth. It's prepared by saut√©ing onions and garlic, then adding celery, parsnips, carrots, leeks, and savoy cabbage, simmered until tender. Grated beets are added later to infuse color and flavor, along with marjoram, dill, bay leaf, and red wine vinegar for seasoning. The soup is typically garnished with sour cream when served.
