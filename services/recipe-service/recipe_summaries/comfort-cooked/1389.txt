This recipe is for Slow Cooker Miso-Butter Roast Chicken and Potatoes. A whole chicken and new potatoes are slow-cooked with a savory miso-butter mixture until tender, then finished under the broiler with a honey-miso glaze for crisp, caramelized skin. It's garnished with fresh chives and served with lemon wedges.
