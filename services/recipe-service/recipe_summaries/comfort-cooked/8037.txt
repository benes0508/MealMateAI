This recipe features a bone-in leg of lamb roasted with Yukon Gold potatoes. The lamb is prepared with a savory paste of garlic, rosemary, and lemon, then chilled overnight. It's initially roasted at a high temperature (425°F), then continues cooking with seasoned Yukon Gold potatoes at a lower temperature (350°F) until both are tender and the lamb reaches 130-135°F for medium-rare. The lamb rests before serving alongside the warmed potatoes. A wine pairing suggestion is included.
