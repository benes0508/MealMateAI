This recipe details an Olive Oil–Confit Chicken with Cipolline Onions. Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs are marinated overnight with lemon, fennel seeds, rosemary, salt, and pepper. They are then slow-baked (confit) at 275°F for 2–2.5 hours in a Dutch oven submerged in olive oil, along with baby Yukon Gold potatoes and cipolline onions, until very tender. The chicken and potatoes are then briefly broiled for crispy skin and browned exteriors. The dish is served with the confit onions, lemon slices, and a drizzle of the flavorful strained oil. The confit portion can be prepared up to two days in advance.
