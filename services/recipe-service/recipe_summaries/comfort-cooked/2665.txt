This recipe is for **Braised Brisket With Hot Sauce and Mixed Chiles**. It involves searing a beef brisket, then braising it with roasted mild and hot chiles, red onion, garlic, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce for 3-3.5 hours until fork-tender. The braising liquid is then reduced to a syrupy sauce for serving.
