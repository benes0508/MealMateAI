Veselka's Famous Borscht is a hearty and complex soup featuring beets, pork, and various vegetables. The preparation involves creating a vibrant "beet water" from simmered beets, cooking whole beets for grating, and preparing a rich pork broth by simmering pork butt until tender. Separately, vegetables like carrots, celery, cabbage, potatoes, and lima beans are cooked in the reserved pork broth. Finally, the beet water, pork broth, cooked vegetables, cubed pork, and grated beets are combined, simmered briefly, and seasoned to taste.
