This recipe details a robust Tomato and Cannellini Bean Soup. It involves first simmering pre-soaked cannellini beans until creamy, then caramelizing whole peeled tomatoes until deeply browned. Aromatics like onion, fennel, and garlic are saut√©ed before combining with the beans, tomatoes, and vegetable broth for a long simmer to meld flavors. Swiss chard is stirred in at the very end until wilted, and the soup is served topped with roasted almonds and a drizzle of olive oil. Both the cooked beans and the finished soup (without chard) can be prepared several days in advance.
