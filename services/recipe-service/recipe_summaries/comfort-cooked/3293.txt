This recipe details how to prepare a show-stopping Crown Roast of Pork. It involves brining the pork overnight, then rubbing it with a savory mixture of garlic, thyme, and mustard before shaping it into a crown and slow-roasting. The dish is accompanied by roasted lady apples and shallots (cooked with bacon) and finished with a pan sauce made from the roast drippings, hard cider, and Dijon mustard.
