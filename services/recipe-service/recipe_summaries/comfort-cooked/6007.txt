This recipe details how to make homemade rice noodles from scratch. It involves a unique, lengthy 4-day fermentation of rice flour and water. After fermentation, the batter is cooked into a thick paste, then kneaded with tapioca starch. The dough is then extruded into noodles using a potato ricer, boiled briefly, and immediately cooled in an ice-water bath. The noodles are best used the same day they are made.
