This recipe guides you through making homemade Mozzarella cheese. The process involves heating whole milk with citric acid to curdle it, then adding rennet to set the curds. After the curds form, they are cut, gently stirred, and drained in cheesecloth to remove the whey. Finally, portions of the drained curds are stretched repeatedly in hot, salted water until smooth and elastic, then formed into balls and cooled.
