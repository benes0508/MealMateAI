A country-style tomato and cilantro broth, deeply aromatic and flavorful. It features a unique blend of whole spices (cinnamon, coriander, cloves, peppercorns, bay, cardamom) simmered with fresh tomatoes, garlic, and ginger. The broth is strained and partially blended with the cooked solids for a smooth, rich consistency, then finished with fresh cilantro.
