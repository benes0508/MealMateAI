This recipe is for a **Five-Spice Roast Chicken** featuring chicken pieces marinated in a blend of Chinese five-spice powder, garlic, salt, and olive oil. The chicken is then roasted at 425Â°F for about 50 minutes on a bed of onion wedges until cooked through, basted occasionally, and rested before serving.
