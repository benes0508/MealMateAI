This recipe details how to make classic Shoe String Potatoes (Pommes Pailles) by peeling and thinly julienning russet potatoes into 1/8-inch strips. These are then deep-fried in batches at 375Â°F until golden brown, drained, and seasoned with salt. A julienne slicer and deep-fat thermometer are recommended.
