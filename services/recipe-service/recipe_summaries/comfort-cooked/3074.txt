This recipe for Hummus Tehina details how to make a creamy hummus from scratch. It involves soaking dried chickpeas overnight with baking soda, then boiling them until very tender and mushy (a key step for creaminess). The cooked chickpeas are then pureed in a food processor with tahini sauce, salt, and cumin until smooth. Serve topped with paprika, parsley, a drizzle of olive oil, and extra tahini if desired.
