This Spring Vegetable Ragoût recipe features a vibrant mix of blanched baby turnips, carrots, fava beans, and fingerling potatoes. It involves preparing an aromatic broth by simmering sautéed leeks and shallots with chicken broth and lemon zest, then straining it. Morels are cooked with white wine, then combined with fennel, asparagus, and bell peppers in the reserved broth. Finally, all the prepared vegetables are gently simmered together until tender, and the dish is served with fresh tarragon, chives, parsley, crusty bread, and Parmesan shavings.
