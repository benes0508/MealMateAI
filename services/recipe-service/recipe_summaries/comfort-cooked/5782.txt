This recipe details the preparation of a **Herb-Crusted Beef Rib Roast** served with roasted potatoes, carrots, and a Pinot Noir jus. A bone-in prime rib is coated in a crushed peppercorn, thyme, and rosemary crust, then seared at high heat before slow-roasting to medium-rare. Yukon Gold potatoes and carrots are roasted until golden, tossed in the beef's rendered fat. A rich Pinot Noir jus is crafted by deglazing the roast pan, reducing wine and beef broth with shallots, and finishing with butter. The sliced beef is served with the vegetables and the savory jus.
