Bhel Poori is a vibrant Indian street food snack, combining crispy puffed rice and chickpea noodles (sev) with diced boiled potatoes, fresh onions, tomatoes, unripe mango, and cilantro. It's tossed with sweet tamarind chutney and spicy cilantro-mint chutney, then served immediately with additional chutneys on the side.
