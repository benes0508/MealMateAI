This recipe details how to prepare **Saffron Steamed Plain Basmati Rice**, a traditional Persian dish renowned for its distinct **tah dig**â€”a golden, crispy bottom crust. The process involves par-boiling basmati rice, then layering a mixture of rice, yogurt, oil/ghee, and saffron water at the bottom of a pot to form the crust, before steaming the remaining rice for an extended period. The dish is typically unmolded as a cake, showcasing the crispy crust, and can also be made using a rice cooker for convenience.
