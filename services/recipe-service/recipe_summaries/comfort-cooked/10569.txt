This recipe details how to prepare **Cabernet-Braised Short Ribs with Gorgonzola Polenta and Mixed-Herb Gremolata**. Beef short ribs are seasoned with rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper, then browned, and slowly braised in two bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon until exceptionally tender. The braising liquid is reduced and thickened to create a rich sauce. The dish is served over creamy Gorgonzola Polenta and finished with a bright, aromatic Mixed-Herb Gremolata. It's a hearty, savory main course, with options for preparing elements ahead of time.
