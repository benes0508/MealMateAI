These Pineapple Truffles are a sweet, tropical, bite-sized dessert. They feature a rich, cooked filling made from pur√©ed pineapple, coconut, and sugars, enriched with tempered egg yolks and cooked until very thick and dry. The mixture is then chilled, formed into small balls, coated in a coconut-sugar blend, and frozen for storage and serving.
