"Edible Stones" is a unique recipe transforming small potatoes into realistic-looking edible stones. It involves slow-poaching garlic in olive oil to create a confit and a creamy alioli. Potatoes are boiled, then coated in a mixture of kaolin (clay), lactose, black dye, and salt, which dries to a crisp, stone-like shell at a low oven temperature. The dish is served with the garlic alioli, often alongside heated river stones for an authentic presentation, encouraging diners to appreciate the contrasting textures of the potato and its "shell."
