This recipe details **Citrus and Chile Braised Short Ribs**, featuring bone-in beef short ribs slow-cooked until fall-off-the-bone tender. The dish is prepared by browning the ribs, then braising them in a rich sauce with aromatics (onions, garlic, celery, carrots), tomato paste, spices (coriander, cumin), chiles de Ã¡rbol, oregano, and a prominent citrus base of orange juice and zest. The braising liquid is reduced to create a flavorful sauce, and the dish is garnished with fresh lime juice, cilantro, and additional chile and orange zest for a vibrant finish. It can be prepared up to 5 days ahead.
