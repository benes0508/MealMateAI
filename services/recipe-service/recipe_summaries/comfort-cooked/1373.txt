This recipe details how to make a luxurious Lobster Shepherd's Pie. It involves roasting potatoes for a creamy, dill and horseradish-infused mashed topping, and preparing a rich sauce from a lobster shell stock, white wine, and vegetables like carrots and pearl onions. Cooked lobster meat is layered with the sauce, topped with the mashed potatoes, and then baked until bubbly and broiled for a golden finish.
