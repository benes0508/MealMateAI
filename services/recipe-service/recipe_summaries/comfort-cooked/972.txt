This recipe details a "Silky Pork and Cumin Stew" featuring slow-cooked, fork-tender pork shoulder in a rich broth infused with onions, garlic, cumin seeds, and dried chiles de Ã¡rbol. A key step involves browning the pork and aromatics, followed by a long simmer and an recommended overnight chilling period to enhance flavor and facilitate fat removal. The stew is served with quick-pickled red cabbage, charred avocados seasoned with chili powder, and optional toppings like corn nuts, chicharrones, hot sauce, or sour cream.
