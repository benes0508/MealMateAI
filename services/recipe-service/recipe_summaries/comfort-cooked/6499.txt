This recipe for Bacon-Infused Carolina Fish Muddle creates a hearty, tomato-based stew. It features a homemade shrimp stock, rendered bacon, and a blend of sautéed vegetables (celery, carrots, onions, leek, garlic, jalapeño) simmered with new potatoes. Fish (bass, grouper) and shrimp are added at the end, cooked until just opaque. The muddle is seasoned and typically served over stone-ground grits or rice, garnished with fresh parsley and bacon-fat croutons.
