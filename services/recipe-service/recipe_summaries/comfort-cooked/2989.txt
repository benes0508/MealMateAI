This recipe offers a unique twist on traditional Matzo Ball Soup, infusing it with aromatic cardamom, earthy turmeric, and vibrant lime zest. The matzo balls are prepared by chilling a dough made with pureed onion, garlic, eggs, club soda, and the aforementioned spices and zest. They are then gently simmered in a savory chicken broth, along with carrots, until cooked through. The soup is finished with fresh cilantro and served with lime wedges for an added citrusy brightness. The matzo balls can also be prepared up to two days in advance.
