This recipe details how to make North Carolina Pulled-Pork Barbecue. It involves preparing a tangy vinegar-based sauce with sugar and red pepper flakes. A bone-in pork shoulder is scored, seasoned, and then slow-grilled indirectly over low heat (250-275°F) for 7-8 hours until fork-tender and an internal temperature of 190°F, requiring regular basting and coal replenishment. The skin can be crisped separately if desired. The pork is then shredded and served on buns with the reserved vinegar sauce and coleslaw.
