This Vegetarian Tagine is a flavorful and hearty one-pot stew featuring butternut squash, cauliflower, and chickpeas, simmered with diced tomatoes, aromatic spices (paprika, cinnamon, cumin, ginger), and a base of onions, garlic, celery, and carrots. Sweetened with raisins or currants, it's served warm over couscous.
