Dominican Sancocho is a rich, hearty stew featuring a combination of multiple meats (beef shank, boneless pork shoulder, chicken thighs, and optional longaniza sausage) slow-simmered with aromatics. A defining characteristic is the diverse array of starchy root vegetables including green plantains, yuca, ñame, white yautía, calabaza (Caribbean pumpkin), and corn, which are added in stages and cooked until very tender, thickening the broth. The stew is finished with fresh citrus juice and typically served with white rice, hot sauce, and avocado.
