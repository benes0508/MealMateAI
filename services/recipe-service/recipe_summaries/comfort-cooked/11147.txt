This Potato Stew features russet potatoes cooked in an annatto-infused oil with onions and spices (cumin, salt, pepper). Half the potatoes are mashed into the broth for thickness, while the rest are simmered whole. Milk and queso fresco are stirred in at the end for creaminess. The stew is served hot, topped with diced avocado.
