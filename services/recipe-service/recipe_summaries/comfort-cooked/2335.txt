This recipe is for a **Reverse Sear Rib-Eye Roast with Fennel and Rosemary**. It features a large beef rib-eye roast seasoned with garlic, dried rosemary, and fennel pollen. The "reverse sear" method involves roasting the beef slowly at a low temperature (225°F) for several hours until almost done, followed by a high-temperature (500°F) sear to create a crispy, browned exterior. The roast is served with a rich, savory **bacon butter** made from rendered bacon fat, browned butter, shallots, chives, and apple cider vinegar.
