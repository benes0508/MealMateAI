Peruvian Ceviche is a refreshing seafood dish featuring white fish (fluke, flounder, or sole) "cooked" by marinating in a vibrant, spicy, and tangy 'leche de tigre.' This marinade is a blend of fresh lime juice, garlic, cilantro, aji limo or habanero chile, and red onion. The dish is traditionally served with steamed sweet potato and corn, balancing the citrus and chili kick with natural sweetness.
