This recipe details braised short ribs infused with unique flavors of chocolate and rosemary. Pancetta and browned short ribs are simmered with a mirepoix base, red wine, chicken broth, tomatoes, and herbs for about 3 hours until very tender. The rich sauce is then finished with bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, and fresh rosemary, creating a deeply savory and complex main course.
