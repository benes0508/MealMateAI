This recipe is for "Carbonnade Ã  la Flamande" Short Ribs, a Belgian-inspired beef stew. Beef short ribs are browned, then simmered with onions, brown ale, stout, beef broth, prunes, brown sugar, and a spice sachet (cinnamon, bay, star anise, peppercorns). A slice of mustard-coated bread is added to thicken the stew. The dish is slow-cooked until the ribs are very tender (about 2.5 hours), then the sauce is strained, reduced, and reunited with the ribs before serving.
