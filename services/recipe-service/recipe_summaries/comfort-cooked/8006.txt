Country Captain with Cauliflower and Peas is a hearty, aromatic main course featuring chicken thighs, cauliflower, and peas simmered in a richly spiced sauce. The dish is characterized by a unique blend of freshly ground spices (coriander, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, cayenne) complemented by ginger, garlic, crushed tomatoes, and unexpected additions like peanut butter and dried cherries, creating a distinctive sweet and savory flavor profile. It's finished with fresh green onions and toasted coconut.
