This recipe is for a traditional Hungarian Beef Gulasch, featuring beef shank or short ribs slow-cooked for 2.5 hours until tender. The rich, smooth sauce is made from deeply caramelized onions, garlic, tomato paste, and a blend of Hungarian sweet and hot paprikas, deglazed with white wine vinegar, and simmered with chicken broth, bay leaves, and lemon peel. The sauce is pureed for a velvety finish before the beef is returned.
