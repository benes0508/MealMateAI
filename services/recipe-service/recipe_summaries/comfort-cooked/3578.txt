This recipe details how to make Sichuan-Style Chicken with Rice Noodles. Chicken is gently poached in an aromatic broth featuring scallions, ginger, star anise, kombu, and Sichuan peppercorns. The poaching liquid is then reduced and used to cook thin rice noodles. A salad of massaged Tuscan kale, seasoned with rice vinegar, soy sauce, and furikake, is combined with the noodles and reserved scallions. The shredded chicken is served alongside, finished with chili oil and additional furikake.
