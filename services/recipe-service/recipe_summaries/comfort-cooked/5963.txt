A recipe for steamed winter squash (e.g., acorn, delicata) served with a rich, aromatic spiced butter. The butter is infused with lime, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and other warming spices, with optional dried rose petals. Squash is sliced (unpeeled) and steamed until tender. A glossy sauce is then created by whisking the spiced butter into the reduced squash steaming liquid, which is drizzled over the squash. Garnished with pomegranate seeds, the spiced butter can be prepared up to a week ahead.
