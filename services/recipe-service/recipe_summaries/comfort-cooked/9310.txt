This recipe details how to make Chipotle Chicken Tortilla Soup, starting with a homemade chicken stock flavored with vegetables and whole spices like cumin, allspice, and black peppercorns. A key component is a pur√©e made from toasted spices blended with chipotles in adobo, onion, and garlic, which is then added to the stock. Brown rice and sweet potatoes are cooked directly in the soup, followed by shredded chicken and black beans. The soup is served with crispy, baked corn tortilla strips, fresh avocado, lime wedges, and cilantro.
