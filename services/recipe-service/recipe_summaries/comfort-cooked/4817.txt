Massaman Chicken is a rich, slow-simmered curry featuring pan-browned chicken, Yukon Gold potatoes, and red onions. It's cooked in a fragrant sauce made with Massaman curry paste, Belgian-style wheat beer, coconut milk, and chicken broth until the chicken is very tender. Finished with fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar, it's served with rice and garnished with cilantro and fried shallots.
