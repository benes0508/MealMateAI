This recipe explains how to make **homemade ricotta cheese** from scratch using just **whole milk, salt, and distilled white vinegar**. The process involves heating the milk to 185Â°F, then adding vinegar to curdle it, and finally draining the curds through cheesecloth. The fresh ricotta lasts about 2 days refrigerated.
