This recipe for **Sunflower Seed "Risotto" with Squash and Mushrooms** offers a unique take on risotto, using sunflower seeds as the base. Raw sunflower seeds are boiled, then a portion is blended with heavy cream and Parmesan to create a creamy sauce. This "risotto" base is cooked with sautéed onion, garlic, thyme, vegetable broth, and white wine until tender. Separately, butternut squash and mushrooms are sautéed with garlic and thyme. The dish is finished by combining the creamy seed mixture with the reduced broth, then topped with the sautéed vegetables, more Parmesan, and fresh thyme.
