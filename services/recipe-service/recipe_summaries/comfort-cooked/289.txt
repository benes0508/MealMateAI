Lentil Kielbassoulet is a hearty and flavorful stew featuring kielbasa sausage, lentils, and wild mushrooms cooked with a rich blend of vegetables like fennel, onion, carrots, and celery, along with garlic, thyme, and paprika. The stew is simmered until thick, then baked in a Dutch oven with two layers of crispy, garlicky, and herbed breadcrumbs, creating a substantial and comforting dish that can be prepared in advance.
