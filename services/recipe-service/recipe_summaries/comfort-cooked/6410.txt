This Cheesy Corn Chowder is a rich, hearty soup featuring a blend of savory bacon, a medley of vegetables (onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, Yukon gold, and sweet potatoes), and corn, all simmered in chicken broth and cream. The chowder is finished by stirring in extra sharp cheddar until melted, along with bacon and fresh basil. It's a comforting, savory dish that would likely be found in the `comfort-cooked` or `protein-mains` recipe collections.
