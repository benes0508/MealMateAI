This recipe prepares tender, gravy-braised turkey legs, featuring browned turkey drumsticks and thighs simmered in a rich, savory sauce. The gravy is built with aromatic vegetables (onion, leek, celery, garlic), deglazed with white wine, and uses turkey stock, with cipolline onions cooked until tender. The sauce is thickened with flour and enriched with an egg yolk and cream liaison for a luscious finish.
