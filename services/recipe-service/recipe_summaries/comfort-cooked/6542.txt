This recipe details how to make **Chicken and Sausage Gumbo**, a hearty Louisiana stew. It features seasoned boneless chicken thighs and spicy smoked sausage, seared and then simmered in a rich, dark roux (made from oil/drippings and flour) with a flavorful base of onions, celery, bell peppers, and garlic. Chicken broth, bay leaves, and thyme are added, and the gumbo is simmered for an extended period until the chicken is very tender and flavors meld. Okra, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce are stirred in towards the end. It's traditionally served over steamed rice, garnished with fresh scallions and optional fil√© powder. The dish can be prepared up to two days in advance.
