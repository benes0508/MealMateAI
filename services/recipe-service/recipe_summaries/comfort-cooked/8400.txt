This recipe details how to make rich and creamy Crème Fraîche and Chive Mashed Potatoes. Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn potatoes are boiled until tender, then riced for a smooth texture. A hot mixture of whole milk, crème fraîche, and butter is gradually incorporated, and fresh chopped chives are folded in at the end. The dish can be prepared up to an hour ahead and reheated.
