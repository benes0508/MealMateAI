This recipe details how to prepare a **Sausage-Stuffed Rack of Pork with Sage**. A bone-in pork loin roast is partially cut, seasoned, and then stuffed with Italian sausage, sage, and scallions before being tied. It's roasted in a pan with celery, black olives, and white wine, initially at 500°F then reduced to 325°F, basted frequently, until it reaches an internal temperature of 155°F. The roast is rested before serving with its pan juices.
