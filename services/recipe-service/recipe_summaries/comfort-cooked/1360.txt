This recipe for **Pork Shoulder Braciola with Rag첫** involves butterflying and flattening a boneless pork shoulder. The pork is then filled with a mixture of eggs, chopped garlic, panko, parsley, rosemary, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and Parmesan. Rolled and tied, it's seared until browned, then slow-roasted in a Dutch oven with whole peeled tomatoes and sliced garlic at 225째F for 4-5 hours, creating a rich rag첫. After resting, the tender pork is sliced and served with pasta tossed in the accompanying rag첫, garnished with Parmesan. The dish can be prepared in advance.
