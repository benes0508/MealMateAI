This recipe details how to make classic Mashed Potatoes. Key ingredients include potatoes (Yukon Gold recommended), schmaltz, salt, and pepper. The process involves peeling, cutting, and soaking potatoes, then boiling until tender. After draining, the potatoes are dried in the hot pot, then mashed (preferably with a ricer) and seasoned with schmaltz, salt, and pepper for a smooth, fluffy texture.
