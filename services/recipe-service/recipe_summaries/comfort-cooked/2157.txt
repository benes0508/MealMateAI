This recipe for "Cold-Fry" Frites provides instructions for making crispy french fries by starting potatoes in room-temperature oil. Key steps include rinsing, peeling, and cutting russet potatoes, then soaking them in cold water to remove starch. The dried potatoes are placed in a heavy-duty pot with room-temperature vegetable oil and brought to a high boil, cooking for about 26 minutes in total until deep golden brown. The method results in fries that are crisp on the outside and creamy within. Tips include using firm potatoes, a cast iron or stainless steel pot, and instructions for reusing the oil.
