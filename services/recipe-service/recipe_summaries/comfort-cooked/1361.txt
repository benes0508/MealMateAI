Classic Cassoulet is a traditional, hearty French stew that is a multi-day culinary project. It features duck legs cured and confited in their own fat, dried beans slow-cooked with pancetta, and a rich pork shoulder ragout. These components are meticulously combined with fresh pork sausage, layered in a pot, and baked repeatedly with breadcrumbs to form multiple golden crusts, resulting in a deeply flavorful and complex dish.
