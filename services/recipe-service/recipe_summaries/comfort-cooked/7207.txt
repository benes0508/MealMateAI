This recipe is for a Turkey Sweet Potato Shepherd's Pie. It features a savory base of ground turkey cooked with onion, carrots, celery, and peas in a rich gravy. This is topped with a unique sweet potato mash, blended with butter, banana, and hot sauce for a balanced flavor, then covered with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The dish is cooked mostly on the stovetop and finished in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.
