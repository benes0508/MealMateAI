This recipe details a Shawarma-Spiced Braised Leg of Lamb. A bone-in leg of lamb is seasoned with a robust spice blend (cumin, caraway, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, chiles, garlic), marinated 12-24 hours, then initially roasted at high heat. It's then slow-braised for 4.5-5.5 hours in a Dutch oven with onions, ancho/chipotle chiles, turmeric, crushed tomatoes, and chicken broth until incredibly tender. The braising liquid is reduced to form a rich sauce. Serve with an herb salad; the dish can be prepared up to two days ahead.
