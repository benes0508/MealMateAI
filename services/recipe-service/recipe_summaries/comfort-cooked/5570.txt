Pot-Roasted Artichokes: Baby artichokes are prepared by trimming and removing the choke, then saut√©ed with garlic in olive oil. They are then braised in white wine until very tender, and finished with capers, fresh mint, and parsley until the tops are deep golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
