A quick stovetop recipe for sliced pork tenderloin simmered in a tangy homemade BBQ-style sauce. The sauce combines ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire, cider vinegar, hot sauce, onion, and garlic. The pork cooks until tender in the simmering sauce, which is then reduced and poured over. Best served with coleslaw.
