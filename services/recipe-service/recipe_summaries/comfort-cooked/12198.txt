This recipe for "Alton's T-Day Gravy" guides you through making a rich, flavorful gravy primarily from scratch. It involves roasting chicken or turkey wings to create a deeply flavored stock, which is then simmered with vegetables and herbs, strained, and chilled overnight. A "schmaltz manié" (flour-fat paste) is prepared from the rendered fat of the stock. Finally, deglazed turkey pan juices are combined with the homemade stock and thickened with the schmaltz manié to achieve a perfect, savory Thanksgiving gravy.
