This recipe for "Mac Sauce (Béchamel 101)" outlines how to make a classic béchamel sauce, intended as a base for mac and cheese. It involves creating a roux from butter and flour, slowly whisking in warm milk, then cooking until the sauce becomes thick, silky, and coats a spoon. Salt is added at the end. The sauce is ready for immediate use, but can also be made ahead and stored, noting it may need thinning with milk before adding cheese.
