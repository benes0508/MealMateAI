Mixed Vegetables with Coconut Sauce (Aviyal) is a vegetarian dish featuring potatoes, carrots, zucchini, and peas. The vegetables are first simmered with green chile, red pepper flakes, turmeric, and salt. A separate paste of grated coconut, cumin, cayenne, and water is blended and then added to the vegetables along with plain yogurt. The mixture is simmered until tender and flavors are blended, and can be served with optional curry leaves and coconut oil.
