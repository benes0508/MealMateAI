This Chickpea Stew is a hearty dish featuring chicken thighs and chickpeas simmered in a savory broth with garlic, cumin, tomato paste, and a touch of red pepper flakes and bay leaves. Roasted red peppers and fresh lemon juice are stirred in at the end for brightness. It's served hot over country-style bread cubes and garnished with fresh parsley.
