This recipe details how to cook semi-polished Japanese rice (Haiga Mai) using both stovetop and rice cooker methods. It emphasizes gentle washing to preserve the nutrient-rich germ. Key steps include carefully rinsing the rice, optionally soaking it, then cooking it (boiling, simmering, and a final brief high heat for stovetop; or simply using the rice cooker's cycle). A crucial final step is to let the rice stand, covered, for at least 10 minutes to achieve the proper texture.
