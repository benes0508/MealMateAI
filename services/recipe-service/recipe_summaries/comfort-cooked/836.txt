This recipe details a hearty Lentil Soup with Wheat Berries and Kale. It begins by saut√©ing finely chopped carrots, onion, and garlic. Wheat berries (or similar grains), coriander, turmeric, and bay leaves are then added and lightly cooked before simmering with water. Finally, lentils and kale are introduced and cooked until tender, resulting in a savory and comforting soup, typically served with Parmesan and crusty bread.
