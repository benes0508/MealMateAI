This recipe details how to prepare "Chicken in Green Pumpkin-Seed Sauce" using chicken thighs. The process involves boiling chicken to yield tender meat and a flavorful broth, toasting and grinding pumpkin seeds (pepitas), and pureeing tomatillos with chiles, cilantro, and garlic. These components are then combined to create a rich, thick green sauce, which is served over the chicken and garnished with reserved pepitas.
