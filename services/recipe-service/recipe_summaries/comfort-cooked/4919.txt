This recipe is for **Indian-Spiced Chicken With Tomato and Cream**. It features chicken legs slow-cooked in a rich, creamy tomato sauce infused with a blend of Indian spices like garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and cardamom. Potatoes are added towards the end to cook until tender. The dish is simmered for 2-3 hours until the chicken is falling off the bone and the sauce is thickened. It's served topped with yogurt and fresh mint, alongside naan, flatbread, or rice. The stew can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
