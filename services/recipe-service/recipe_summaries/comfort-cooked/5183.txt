This recipe is for a **Honey-Vinegar Leg of Lamb with Roasted Fennel and Carrots**. A leg of lamb is first rubbed with a savory herb paste (garlic, parsley, fennel seeds, oil, salt, pepper) and chilled overnight. A sweet-tangy glaze is made from reduced red wine vinegar and honey. The lamb is then roasted alongside fennel bulbs and carrots, initially at 325째F until 100째F internal temperature, then glazed and finished at 450째F until 120째F (resulting in medium-rare after resting). The vegetables continue roasting until tender. The dish is served with the roasted vegetables and fresh fennel fronds. Preparations for the lamb and vegetables can be done a day ahead.
