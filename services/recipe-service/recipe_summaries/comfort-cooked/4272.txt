This recipe for "Extra-Buttery Mashed Spuds" creates smooth, rich mashed potatoes using Yukon Gold potatoes, whole milk, and a substantial amount of unsalted butter. Key techniques include simmering potatoes to prevent waterlogging, drying them after cooking, and ricing them while hot to ensure a lump-free, creamy texture. The milk and butter are warmed with optional herbs before being vigorously stirred into the riced potatoes. The final dish is served with extra pats of butter for maximum richness.
