Atlanta Brisket is a braised beef brisket dish where the brisket is first marinated for 24 hours in Coca-Cola. After browning, it's slow-cooked for 4 hours at 325Â°F in an oven with a gravy made from the reserved Coca-Cola marinade, dry onion soup mix, tomato sauce, ketchup, sliced yellow onions, and bay leaves. It's served sliced, smothered with the pan gravy and onions.
