This recipe features roasted Walla Walla onions, scooped out and filled with a savory pine mushroom and Gruyère fonduta. The creamy filling is made with sautéed pine mushrooms, chopped onion innards, a béchamel-like base, day-old sourdough, and melted Gruyère. The stuffed onions are then baked until bubbly and served hot, typically with extra sourdough bread.
