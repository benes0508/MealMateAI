This recipe describes a flavorful Fish Soup with Tomatoes and Red Pepper-Garlic Sauce. It features lingcod fillets, tomatoes, potatoes, onion, and fennel in a fish stock base, subtly flavored with saffron and orange peel. A distinctive homemade Red Pepper-Garlic Sauce (Rouille), made from roasted bell pepper, cooked potato, garlic, and olive oil, is prepared separately and served spread on toasted French bread rounds as an accompaniment.
