This recipe details how to prepare **Herb-Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Sage**. A whole chicken is marinated for 24 hours in olive oil with lemon slices and fresh sage. It's then roasted, breast-side up, initially at 450°F with optional root vegetables and water in the pan, followed by a reduction to 325°F until the internal temperature reaches 165°F, resulting in a flavorful and tender roasted chicken.
