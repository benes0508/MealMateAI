This recipe features **Chile-Braised Short Ribs**, prepared with a rich, aromatic sauce made from rehydrated guajillo/ancho chiles, charred onion and garlic, and a blend of spices (coriander, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes), thickened with tomato paste. The flanken-style short ribs are first browned, then slowly braised in the chile pur√©e for 3-3.5 hours until very tender. Acorn squash is added towards the end to cook in the sauce. The dish is served with Greek yogurt, fresh cilantro, and lime wedges. It can be made ahead.
