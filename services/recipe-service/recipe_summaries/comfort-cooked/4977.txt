This recipe details how to prepare a rich **Ragout of Lamb Shoulder with Cavatelli**. It involves searing bone-in lamb shoulder seasoned with fennel and rosemary, then slow-cooking it with aromatics (leeks, celery, garlic), anchovies, tomato paste, red wine, red pearl onions, and veal stock until very tender (about 2 hours). The lamb is then pulled from the bone, combined with the sauce, cooked cavatelli pasta, and fresh sweet peas, and warmed before serving.
