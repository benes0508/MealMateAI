This is a creamy potato salad made with tender baby red potatoes. It features a rich mayonnaise-based dressing brightened by unseasoned rice vinegar, fresh lemon peel, and a generous blend of fresh herbs including parsley, basil, and dill. Green onions and celery add a pleasant crunch. The dish can be prepared up to 8 hours in advance.
