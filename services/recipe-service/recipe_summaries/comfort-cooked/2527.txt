This recipe describes a "Fridge-Dive Pesto Pasta," a unique pasta dish emphasizing flexible ingredients. It features a vibrant, non-traditional pesto made from blanched mixed greens, red onion, toasted sesame seeds, and ricotta salata. The sauce base involves browning garlic, and the pasta is cooked directly in the reserved greens' blanching water. The al dente pasta is then tossed with the pesto, butter, and finished with more ricotta salata and sesame seeds.
