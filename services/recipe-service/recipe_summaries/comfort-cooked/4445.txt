This recipe details how to make homemade ricotta cheese using whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and lemon juice. The process involves heating the dairy mixture to a boil, adding lemon juice to curdle it, then draining the curds through cheesecloth to achieve the desired consistency. The resulting ricotta can be used immediately (e.g., on crostini, pasta, pizza, or in eggs) and stored for up to a week.
