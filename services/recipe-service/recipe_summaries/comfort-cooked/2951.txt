A hearty, lemony chicken soup featuring shredded chicken, farro, cannellini beans, and kale. The rich broth is first simmered with aromatics and, optionally, a chicken carcass for deep flavor. Toasted farro is cooked separately, then combined with the strained broth, chicken, beans, and vegetables. Finished with fresh lemon juice and dill, it's served with toasted baguette slices and lemon wedges. Optional radish top salsa verde adds a unique twist. This soup can be made up to two days ahead.
