This recipe is for classic **Cheese Fondue**, made by rubbing a pot with garlic, simmering dry white wine, then gradually melting in grated Emmental and Gruy√®re cheeses, stirring constantly in a zigzag motion. A cornstarch-kirsch (or water/wine) mixture is added to thicken the fondue. It's typically served in a fondue pot over a flame with dippers like bread cubes, apple/pear, roasted potatoes, raw bell pepper, or blanched broccoli. Beverage pairings include dry white wine, certain beers, cider, or Fino Sherry.
