"The Minimalist's Corn Chowder" is a simple soup that leverages fresh corn. It's made by simmering corn cobs to create a flavorful broth, which is then used to cook saut√©ed onions and potatoes until tender. Fresh corn kernels and milk are added at the very end and heated through to prevent overcooking the corn. The dish is seasoned to taste and can be garnished with fresh parsley. Key tips include chopping potatoes small for faster cooking and adding tender corn kernels only when the chowder is almost ready.
