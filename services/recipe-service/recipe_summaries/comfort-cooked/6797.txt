Pot-Au-Feu is a classic, hearty French beef stew. It features multiple cuts of beef (brisket, short ribs, oxtails, veal, marrow bones) and garlic sausage, slow-simmered with aromatic vegetables and herbs to create a rich, flavorful broth. Root vegetables like carrots, rutabaga, potatoes, and cabbage are cooked in the strained broth. The dish is traditionally served with the meats, vegetables, and broth separately, complemented by various condiments such as salsa verde, horseradish crème fraîche, mustards, and toasted country bread.
