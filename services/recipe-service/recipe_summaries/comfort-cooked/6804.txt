A classic Chicken Pot Pie featuring a homemade, flaky pastry crust. The hearty filling consists of shredded chicken, a blend of roasted and cooked vegetables (carrots, peas, pearl onions, celery, leeks, potatoes), and both dried and fresh mushrooms (chanterelle/shiitake and button). This is all suspended in a rich, savory gravy made from scratch by poaching a whole chicken, reducing the flavorful broth, and thickening it with a roux and aromatic herbs like thyme, sage, and rosemary. The pie is baked until golden brown and bubbly.
