Chipotle Cranberry Sauce is a sweet and spicy condiment. Dried chipotle chiles are first simmered until tender, then combined with fresh or frozen cranberries, sugar, and lemon juice. The mixture is cooked until cranberries pop, then garlic, cinnamon, and cumin are stirred in and the sauce is simmered to thicken. The softened chipotles are minced and returned to the sauce for a smoky kick. It's then cooled, covered, and chilled, and can be made up to a week in advance.
