"The Simplest Roast Turkey" recipe details how to roast a 14-16 lb turkey, seasoned with salt and pepper, at 450°F for 1.75-2.5 hours until the thigh reaches 170°F, followed by a 30-minute rest. It also provides instructions for safely stuffing the turkey (requiring separate baking of stuffing to 165°F) and a variation for roasting a turkey breast with adjusted times. An instant-read thermometer is essential for doneness.
