This recipe is for a **Janet McCracken's Rib Roast with Tapenade**. A beef rib eye roast is seasoned with salt, pepper, and a homemade tapenade (black and green olives, olive oil, herbs, garlic, anchovy) and marinated overnight. The roast is then seared at a high temperature (425°F) before being slow-roasted at 325°F until medium-rare. A savory pan sauce is prepared from the roast drippings, red wine, and broth, thickened with a butter-flour roux.
