This recipe details a Rigatoni with Spicy Calabrese-Style Pork Ragù. It involves browning Italian sausage and ground pork, then slow-cooking them for approximately 4 hours in a rich sauce made from a finely chopped aromatic base (onion, carrot, celery, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes), tomato paste, and puréed tomatoes. The deeply flavored ragù is then tossed with al dente rigatoni, pasta cooking liquid, Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley for a hearty, spicy, and tender meal. The ragù can be prepared up to 3 days in advance or frozen.
