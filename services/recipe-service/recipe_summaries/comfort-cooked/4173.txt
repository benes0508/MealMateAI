This recipe is for **Braised Veal Shanks with Bacon-Parmesan Crumbs**. Whole veal shanks are seasoned and browned, then slow-braised in the oven with onions, garlic, fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage, bay leaves), white wine, tomatoes, and chicken broth until extremely tender. The braising liquid is strained and reduced into a rich sauce. A crispy topping is made from browned bacon, toasted breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, and fresh sage. The dish is served by spooning the reduced braising liquid over the veal and topping it with the savory breadcrumb mixture. It can be prepared up to two days in advance.
