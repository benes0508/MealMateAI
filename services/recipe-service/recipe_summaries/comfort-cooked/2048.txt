This recipe details how to make "Triple-Cooked Fries" using russet potatoes. The method involves three distinct cooking stages: first boiling the potatoes until tender, then frying them at a lower temperature (275°F), and finally frying them a third time at a higher temperature (375°F) in beef tallow or duck fat until golden and crispy. The fries are chilled between each frying stage. They are finished with salt and fresh parsley.
