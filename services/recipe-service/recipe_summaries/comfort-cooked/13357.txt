Paprika Chicken is a savory main course featuring chicken thighs simmered in a rich sauce. The dish starts by rendering chicken skin for fat, then cooking onions, paprika, whole tomatoes, and chicken broth. The sauce is thickened with a flour mixture and finished with sour cream, served over egg noodles or rice.
