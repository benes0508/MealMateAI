This recipe details how to make **Braised Chicken Thighs with Squash and Mustard Greens**. Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs are first pan-seared until crisp, then braised with aromatic scallions, ginger, and chiles in a savory-sweet sauce made from white wine, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and chicken broth. Acorn squash and mustard greens are added to cook in the same liquid, which is then reduced to a thin gravy. The dish is finished with rice vinegar, fresh scallions, and toasted sesame seeds, and served over white rice. It can be prepared up to two days in advance.
