This hearty Minestrone soup features smoked ham hocks and navy beans slow-simmered with butternut squash, green beans, spinach, and aromatic vegetables like onion, leeks, celery, and garlic in a rich broth. Small pasta is cooked separately and added to individual servings. The soup is finished with fresh parsley and served with a vibrant Arugula Salsa Verde. It can be made up to 3 days ahead.
