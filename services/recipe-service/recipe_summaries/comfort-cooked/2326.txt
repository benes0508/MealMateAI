This recipe features duck prepared in two distinct ways: slow-braised duck legs until tender, finished with a crispy roasted skin, and pan-seared duck breasts with a golden, crisp skin. Both are served with a sweet and savory clementine-fig relish, simmered with brandy, mustard, and spices. The duck legs and relish can be prepared several days in advance.
