This recipe details a rich Chicken and Tomato Stew featuring tender chicken legs simmered in a savory, warm-spiced tomato base with honey. A unique element is the separately prepared caramelized lemon topping, made by boiling and pan-frying sugared lemon slices, which adds bright, sweet-tart notes. The stew is garnished with toasted sesame seeds and fresh mint, and served with flatbread.
