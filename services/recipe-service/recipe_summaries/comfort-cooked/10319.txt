This recipe is for **Tapenade-Stuffed Leg of Lamb**. A boneless leg of lamb is unrolled, spread with tapenade, then rolled and tied. Garlic slices are inserted into slits, and the roast is seasoned with rosemary, salt, and pepper. It's roasted at 350°F for about 1 hour and 15 minutes until medium-rare (140-150°F), then rested before slicing.
