This recipe details how to prepare a **Roast Rack of Lamb with Natural Jus**. It involves seasoning and roasting a rack of lamb on a bed of browned lamb trimmings (fonçage) in a 450°F (230°C) oven for about 25 minutes, followed by a 15-minute rest. The natural jus is made by repeatedly deglazing the roasting pan with broth, boiling to caramelize the pan juices, and scraping them up, resulting in a rich, flavorful sauce to accompany the lamb.
