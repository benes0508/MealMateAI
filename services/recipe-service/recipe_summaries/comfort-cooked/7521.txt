Celery and Pear Bisque is a creamy, pureed soup combining the fresh notes of celery with the subtle sweetness of pears, enhanced by leeks, bay leaves, and thyme. The ingredients are cooked in butter, thickened with flour and chicken broth, then blended to a smooth, velvety consistency. It's typically garnished with finely diced pear and fresh celery leaves.
