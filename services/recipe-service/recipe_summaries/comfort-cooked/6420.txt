This recipe for "Shellfish and Potatoes à la Marinière" is a French-inspired dish featuring a medley of shellfish (littleneck clams, mussels, cockles, optional razor clams) and tender baby potatoes. It's prepared by sautéing fennel, shallots, and garlic, then cooking the shellfish with white wine. A vibrant green sauce is made by blending the cooking liquid with the aromatics, fresh parsley, and butter, which is then poured over the shellfish and potatoes for a rich and flavorful meal.
