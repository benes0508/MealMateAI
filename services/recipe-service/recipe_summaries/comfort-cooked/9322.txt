This recipe details how to make a **Porcini Mushroom Soup**. It involves rehydrating dried porcini mushrooms, then sautéing a mirepoix (onion, celery, carrot, garlic) with fresh white mushrooms. Drained diced tomatoes are added, along with the porcini soaking liquid and water, and the mixture is simmered. A portion of the soup is puréed and returned to the pot, then finished with fresh parsley and dill for a savory, hearty mushroom soup.
