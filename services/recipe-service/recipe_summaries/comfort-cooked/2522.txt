**Sausage, Greens, and Beans Pasta** is a hearty, savory dish featuring spicy Italian sausage, browned chickpeas (some mashed for texture), and wilted greens (like escarole or kale) tossed with large tubular pasta. The sauce is built in one pot with white wine, enriched with Parmesan cheese and butter, and finished with crispy rosemary.
