This recipe details how to prepare a **Beef Rib Roast with Garlic and Rosemary**. A 9-10 lb bone-in prime rib is rubbed with a pulsed mixture of garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, then marinated chilled for at least 8 hours (up to 1 day). After coming to room temperature, it's roasted in a two-stage process: 20 minutes at 450째F, then 1.5-2 hours at 350째F until an internal temperature of 110째F is reached. The roast is then rested for 30 minutes, allowing it to reach medium-rare (approx. 130째F).
