This recipe details how to prepare **Braised Veal Breast with Potato-and-Onion Stuffing**. It involves first making a savory stuffing from cooked Yukon gold potatoes, browned onions, egg, and dill. This stuffing is then used to fill a pocket cut into a bone-in veal breast, which is then sewn closed. The veal is browned, deglazed with white wine, then braised with chicken broth and bay leaves in the oven at 350Â°F for about 2 hours until very tender. Finally, the pan juices are reduced and thickened with cream and cornstarch to create a sauce, finished with fresh dill and lemon juice, to be served with the sliced stuffed veal.
