This recipe details preparing a Mustard Fennel Pork Loin with Cumberland Pan Sauce. A butterflied pork loin is seasoned with a bay leaf, fennel, and salt rub, coated with coarse grain mustard and olive oil, then marinated for at least 12 hours. It's roasted at high heat then reduced, until it reaches 145Â°F, followed by a resting period. A flavorful pan sauce is made by deglazing the roasting pan with water and ruby port, then incorporating orange and lemon juices, red currant jelly, ginger, and thickened with a cornstarch slurry and finished with butter. The sliced pork is served with this rich sauce.
