This recipe details a hearty Goose Stew with Barley and Celery Root. It involves browning goose legs, then simmering them with onions, mushrooms, marjoram, and stock for 2-3 hours until tender. The meat is then pulled from the bone and returned to the pot with pearled barley, carrots, and celery root, cooking until tender. The stew is served garnished with fresh dill and a dollop of sour cream.
