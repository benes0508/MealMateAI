This recipe details how to make Polow, a fragrant Persian rice dish. Basmati rice is partially boiled, then layered in a pot with a yogurt-saffron-rice mixture (which forms a crispy bottom crust called tahdig), fresh dill, and pistachios. It's then steamed until tender, resulting in fluffy rice with a distinctive crispy, golden crust served on top.
