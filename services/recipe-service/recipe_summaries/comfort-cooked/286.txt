This recipe features short tube pasta tossed in a creamy, emulsified sauce made from browned butter, pasta cooking liquid, and Parmesan cheese. Thinly sliced lemon is cooked with the butter to infuse flavor, with some reserved for garnish. The dish is finished with a generous amount of black pepper.
