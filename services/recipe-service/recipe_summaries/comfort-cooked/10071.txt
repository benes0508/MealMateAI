A hearty French classic, Pot-au-Feu features beef chuck roast and short ribs, initially roasted for deep flavor, then slow-simmered for hours with aromatics to create a rich, savory broth. Various root vegetables and leeks are cooked in the same broth, with optional marrowbones prepared separately. It's served as a complete meal with the tender meats, vegetables, strained broth, and traditional accompaniments like Dijon mustard, horseradish, and cornichons.
