This recipe details how to prepare **Lamb Shanks with Pomegranate and Walnuts**, a flavorful braised dish. Lamb shanks are generously seasoned with an aromatic spice blend (cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, cardamom), seared, then slow-cooked in a rich liquid of red wine, chicken broth, pomegranate juice, and pomegranate molasses with onions, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves until fork-tender. The braising liquid is then reduced with walnuts and butter to create a velvety sauce. The dish is typically served over polenta and garnished with fresh lemon zest. It can be prepared a day in advance.
