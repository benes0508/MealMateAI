This recipe for **Roasted Fresh Ham with Citrus and Rye** prepares a substantial 12-pound fresh ham, ideal for a special occasion. The ham undergoes a crucial **four-day dry brine** with sage, orange zest, and red pepper flakes, infusing it with deep savory and citrus notes. It's then roasted to a golden, crisp finish, with star anise added during cooking for aromatic depth. The dish is served with a rich pan sauce made from the ham's drippings, reduced rye whiskey, and fresh orange juice. This complex and flavorful main course requires significant advance preparation due to the brining process.
