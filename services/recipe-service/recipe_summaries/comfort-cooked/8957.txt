This recipe is for **Thyme Honey Glazed Ham**. A fully cooked ham is prepared by scoring its fat, then partially baked covered. Meanwhile, a glaze is made from reduced cider vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme butter. The ham is then brushed with the glaze in two stages and baked uncovered until deep golden-brown and heated through.
