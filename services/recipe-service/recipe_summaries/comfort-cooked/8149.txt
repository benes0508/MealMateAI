This recipe details how to prepare a "Salt-and Spice-Packed Pork Loin." A bone-in pork rib roast is seasoned with salt, pepper, and fennel, then seared. It's then fully encased in a salt crust made with coarse salt, black pepper, allspice, and juniper berries, and roasted at 250°F until it reaches 165°F (about 2.5 hours). After resting, the salt crust is removed, the bone slab is separated, and the pork is carved and served. A Côtes du Rhône wine pairing is suggested.
