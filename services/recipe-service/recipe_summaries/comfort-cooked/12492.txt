This Corn Chowder is a rich, creamy soup made with fresh corn, yellow-fleshed and sweet potatoes, and a blend of saut√©ed vegetables (onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper). Simmered in chicken broth and heavy cream with fresh thyme, it's finished with crispy bacon bits and seasoned, often garnished with chives and diced tomatoes.
