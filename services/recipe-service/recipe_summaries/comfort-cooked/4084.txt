This recipe is for **Crock Pot Pulled Pork Tacos**. A pork shoulder is seasoned with a blend of spices (cumin, garlic, chili, onion powder, paprika, oregano, salt) and slow-cooked in a Crock Pot with mild salsa for 8-12 hours until tender. The cooked pork is then shredded, mixed with some of the cooking juices, and served in corn or flour tortillas.
