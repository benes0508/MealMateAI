Texas Beef Brisket Chili is a hearty, slow-cooked chili featuring cubed beef brisket, rehydrated ancho chiles, and a rich blend of spices (chili powder, cumin, oregano, coriander). It's oven-braised for several hours with fire-roasted tomatoes, Mexican beer, and green chiles until the beef is tender, with butternut squash added towards the end. It's often garnished with fresh cilantro, red onion, avocado, and cheese, served with tortillas.
