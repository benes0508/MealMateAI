Classic Chicken Pho (Phở Gà) is a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup. The recipe involves **charring ginger and onions** for an aromatic base, **parboiling chicken parts** to achieve a clear broth, then **simmering a whole chicken and additional chicken parts/bones with spices** (coriander seeds, cloves, cilantro, rock sugar, salt) for over two hours. The whole chicken is removed and cooled after about 25 minutes to preserve its texture, while the bones continue to simmer. The rich **broth is then strained and seasoned with fish sauce**. Bowls are prepared with **rice noodles, sliced cooked chicken**, and fresh garnishes such as **thinly sliced onions, green onions, and cilantro**, before being topped with the hot, flavorful broth.
