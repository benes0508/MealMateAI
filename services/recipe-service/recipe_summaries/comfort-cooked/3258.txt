This recipe is for a New York Strip Roast with a flavorful Rosemary-Orange Crust and an accompanying Herbed Butter. The roast is seasoned with salt, then coated in a puréed mixture of anchovies, garlic, rosemary, orange zest, and olive oil, with breadcrumbs added to form the crust. It's roasted at 350°F (after an initial 500°F sear) until desired doneness (120-130°F). A separate herbed butter, made from butter, parsley, and some of the garlic mixture, is prepared and chilled to serve alongside the sliced roast.
