This recipe details a Stuffed Veal Roast, featuring a flavorful stuffing made from mushrooms, defrosted spinach, rosemary, pimiento-stuffed olives, orange, and lemon zest. The veal is untied, seasoned, spread with the stuffing, then re-rolled and tied. It's first seared in a skillet until golden, then roasted in the oven at 375Â°F. During roasting, it's basted with a sweet and tangy glaze of honey, apricot preserves, and mustard, ensuring a juicy, slightly pink center.
