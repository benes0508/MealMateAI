This recipe details how to make **Grilled Chive Potatoes**. Red-skinned potatoes are boiled until tender, then halved and slightly flattened. They are then brushed with a melted butter mixture infused with fresh chives and lemon peel, grilled cut-side down until crispy and browned, and finished with a final drizzle of the chive butter.
