This recipe is for Hot Slow-Roasted Pork, Onion, and Mozzarella Sandwiches. A whole pork shoulder is seasoned with a garlic-herb paste, slow-roasted for approximately 4.5 hours until tender, then sliced. A savory sauce is made from the degreased pan drippings. Onions and bell peppers are sautéed until tender. The sandwiches are assembled with the warm pork, sauce, sautéed vegetables, and sliced fresh mozzarella on toasted crusty rolls, then served warm.
