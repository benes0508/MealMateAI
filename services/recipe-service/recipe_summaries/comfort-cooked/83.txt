This recipe details how to make Dashi, a traditional Japanese stock. It involves soaking kombu, dried shiitake mushrooms, and dried anchovies in cold water overnight, then gently simmering the mixture for 80-90 minutes until it develops a soft, slightly viscous texture and a balanced sweet, deep sea flavor. The dashi is then strained and can be refrigerated for up to 2 days, though it's best used fresh. A vegetarian option using only kombu and shiitake is also mentioned.
