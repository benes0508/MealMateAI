This recipe is for "Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes" made with Yukon gold potatoes. Key steps involve boiling the potatoes until tender, then ricing or milling them. A rich mixture of warm milk, heavy cream, garlic, and rosemary (strained) is gradually incorporated with generous amounts of butter into the riced potatoes, creating a smooth and creamy texture. The dish can be prepared a day ahead and reheated.
