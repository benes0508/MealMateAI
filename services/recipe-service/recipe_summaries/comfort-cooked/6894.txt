Cherry Chipotle Chili is a unique and flavorful chili made with lean ground turkey, carrots, onions, and white beans. Its distinct sweet and smoky taste comes from a combination of diced tomatoes, black cherries, and chipotle chiles. The dish is simmered until thickened and can be optionally garnished with nonfat plain Greek yogurt and fresh cilantro before serving.
