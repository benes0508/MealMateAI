This recipe details how to prepare a **Cajun-Spiced Turkey**. A 12-14 lb turkey is seasoned generously with salt, pepper, and Cajun spice mix, then refrigerated uncovered overnight. It's stuffed with a mirepoix (celery, bell pepper, onion) and brushed with oil before roasting. The turkey is initially roasted breast-side down at 375°F for 1 hour, then flipped and roasted for another 1-1.5 hours until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F in the thigh. After cooking, it rests for 20 minutes before carving.
