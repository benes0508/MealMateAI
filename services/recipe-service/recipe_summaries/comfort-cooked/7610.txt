A hearty chicken soup that utilizes leftover roast chicken and its carcass to create a rich, homemade broth. This broth is then combined with a medley of diced root vegetables (carrots, celery root, sweet potatoes, parsnips) and saut√©ed aromatics. The diced chicken meat is added back at the end, resulting in a comforting and flavorful meal.
