Minestrone Salad is a refreshing pasta salad featuring cooked fingerling or baby red potatoes, blanched green beans and asparagus, short pasta, cannellini beans, and roasted peppers, all tossed with pesto. The components are cooked separately (potatoes and pasta boiled, vegetables blanched) then combined and seasoned.
