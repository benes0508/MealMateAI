This recipe details how to prepare a Turkish Coffee-Rubbed Brisket with roasted root vegetables. A brisket is generously rubbed with a blend of finely ground coffee, cinnamon, and cardamom, then roasted alongside onions, potatoes, carrots, fennel, and garlic. The dish is initially seared at a higher temperature, then slow-roasted for several hours until fork-tender. After cooking, it's chilled overnight for easy fat removal and slicing, then reheated and served with its thickened pan juices.
