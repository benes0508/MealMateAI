This Instant-Pot Vegan Cauliflower Queso is a dairy-free dip. It's made by pressure cooking cauliflower, carrots, and cashews, then blending them with nutritional yeast, spices, and the liquid from diced tomatoes with green chiles for a smooth, cheesy sauce. Drained diced tomatoes with green chiles, along with optional fresh vegetables like bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro, are stirred in at the end. Serve warm or at room temperature.
