This recipe creates a two-part dessert: **Rhubarb Sorbet** and **Vanilla Rhubarb Compote**.

The sorbet is made by macerating and cooking rhubarb with sugar and corn syrup, then pur√©eing, chilling, and freezing it in an ice cream maker. The compote consists of gently simmered rhubarb slices in a sugar syrup infused with vanilla. Both components are chilled, with the sorbet served slightly softened and topped with the compote.
