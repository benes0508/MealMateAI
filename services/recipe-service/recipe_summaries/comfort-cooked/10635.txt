This recipe is for a Colombian chicken, corn, and potato stew. It involves simmering a whole chicken to create a flavorful broth, then cooking a blend of papas criollas (or russet), Yukon Gold, and boiling potatoes until the broth thickens. Corn is added, followed by shredded chicken. The stew is served hot with sides of crema, capers, avocado, and fresh cilantro.
