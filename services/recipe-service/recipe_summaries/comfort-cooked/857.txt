This recipe is for a **Slow Roast Beef** using a New York strip roast, seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper, and chilled for 12 hours to 2 days. The beef is slow-roasted at 200°F until medium-rare (118-120°F internal temp), rested for an hour, then quickly seared for browning. It's served thinly sliced with a tangy homemade horseradish sauce (yogurt, sour cream, horseradish, lemon zest), warm rolls, and cornichons. The beef can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
