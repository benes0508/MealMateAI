This recipe details a rich, slow-cooked **Chicken and Dumplings with Mushrooms**. It involves crisping bacon, browning chicken legs, then building a savory stew base with onions, garlic, white wine, herbs, and chicken broth. The chicken simmers for 2-2.5 hours until falling off the bone, with browned mushrooms added towards the end. Fluffy, nutmeg-spiced dumplings are made separately and added to the stew just before serving.
