This recipe details how to make Japanese-Style Curry (Karei Raisu), featuring fatty beef (such as chuck short rib or belly), yellow onion, carrots, and potato cooked with medium hot Vermont curry paste. The process involves saut√©ing onions, browning the beef, then simmering with vegetables and water for an hour until the beef is tender, before adding the curry paste and salt for a final 15 minutes of cooking. It is traditionally served immediately over short grain white rice.
