This Salmon Chowder is a rich and hearty creamy soup. It features salmon, potatoes, corn, and scallions, with bacon rendered to provide a flavorful base for saut√©ing aromatics like garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. A creamy broth is built with whole milk and heavy cream, into which pre-cooked potatoes, salmon, and the crisp bacon are simmered until the fish is tender. The chowder is brightened with fresh lemon juice and garnished with chives.
