This Peruvian-style Scallop Ceviche features briefly poached scallops (not raw) marinated in a vibrant "Tiger's Milk" sauce made with lime juice, pisco, and aj√≠ amarillo chile paste. It's complemented by steamed sweet potato, choclo (Peruvian corn), thinly sliced red onion, bell pepper, and fresh cilantro. Served chilled, it's recommended with a Sauvignon Blanc.
