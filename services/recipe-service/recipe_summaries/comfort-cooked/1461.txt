This recipe details how to make Instant Pot Hard-Boiled Eggs using water, up to 12 large eggs, and an ice bath. The eggs are cooked under high pressure for either 2 or 5 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release (15 minutes for 2-minute cook, 5 minutes for 5-minute cook) before being transferred to an ice bath for cooling and easy peeling.
