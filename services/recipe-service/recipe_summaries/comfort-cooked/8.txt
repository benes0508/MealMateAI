This recipe is for Instant Pot Lamb Haleem, a hearty South Asian stew. It involves soaking a mix of dals (lentils), rice, and barley, then pressure cooking them with seasoned bone-in lamb stew meat, aromatics like shallots and ginger, and spices including garam masala, cayenne, and turmeric. A key cooking technique called "bhuna" is used to develop the spice flavors. The haleem is cooked until the lamb is falling apart and the dals and grains have melted into the stew, then finished with cilantro. It's served with crispy shallots and ginger, fresh cilantro, chopped white onion, and lime wedges. Alternative instructions for Dutch oven or stovetop pressure cooker are also provided.
