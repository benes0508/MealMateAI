This recipe details roasting a whole chicken at 375Â°F. The chicken is prepped by buttering under the skin and stuffing the cavity with orange, ginger, and garlic. It's roasted while basted with reduced sherry, and then frequently brushed with a maple-soy, rice vinegar, and hot pepper sauce glaze until cooked through. The pan juices are then used to create a flavorful accompanying sauce.
