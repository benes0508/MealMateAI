This recipe details preparing a **Salted Roast Turkey with Herbs and Shallot-Dijon Gravy**. A turkey is brined for 18-24 hours with a fragrant herb and salt rub. It's then stuffed with aromatics, buttered, and slow-roasted at 325Â°F for 3.75-4.25 hours until thoroughly cooked. A rich gravy is made from the reserved pan drippings, shallots, white wine, turkey stock, and Dijon mustard, optionally incorporating chopped giblets.
