This She-Crab Soup is a rich, creamy seafood dish centered around blue crabs, particularly their roe. The recipe involves boiling and meticulously picking fresh crabs, then creating a concentrated broth from their shells. A roux of butter and shallots forms the base, which is then combined with the crab broth, liquefied roe, half-and-half, and dry sherry. The soup is simmered until thickened, and the picked crab meat is stirred in just before serving. It's traditionally garnished with more roe, fresh chives, and an extra splash of sherry.
