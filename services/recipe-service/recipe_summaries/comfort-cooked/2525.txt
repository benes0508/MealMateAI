This recipe creates a savory pasta dish featuring dissolved anchovies for a deep umami flavor and a kick from Calabrian chiles. Brightened by lemon zest and juice, the pasta is tossed in a rich, emulsified sauce with Pecorino and butter. It's finished with a generous topping of crispy, garlicky lemon breadcrumbs for contrasting texture and aroma.
