This recipe details how to make Porchetta, a savory, rolled pork roast. It involves preparing a pork belly (scoring and piercing the skin, then pounding it) and a pork loin, seasoning them with a fragrant mixture of toasted fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, sage, rosemary, and garlic, plus salt and orange slices. The loin is rolled inside the belly and tied. After air-drying in the refrigerator, the porchetta is roasted at a high temperature (500°F) to crisp the skin, then at a lower temperature (300°F) until the internal temperature reaches 145°F, followed by a resting period before slicing.
