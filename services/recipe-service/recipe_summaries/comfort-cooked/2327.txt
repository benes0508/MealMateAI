This recipe details Coq au Vin with Cocoa Powder, a classic French chicken stew with a unique twist. Chicken is first marinated for 1-2 days in red wine, herbs, onion, and carrot. It's then browned along with bacon, mushrooms, and pearl onions (cooked separately). The chicken is braised in the strained marinade until tender. Finally, the braising liquid is reduced into a rich, silky sauce, finished with unsweetened cocoa powder and red wine vinegar, before combining all ingredients.
