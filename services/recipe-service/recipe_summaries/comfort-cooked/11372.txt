A recipe for **Roast Heirloom Goose with Balsamic Vinegar** that serves two whole geese. Key steps include scoring the skin and refrigerating the geese uncovered for 1-2 days to ensure crisp skin. The geese are roasted with sage, thyme, lemon, garlic, and onion initially breast-side down, then breast-side up, at 325°F for a total of approximately 3.5 hours until an internal temperature of 175-180°F is reached. After resting, it's served with aged balsamic vinegar or pan sauce.
