This recipe details a Braised Beef Chuck Roast, slow-cooked in the oven with red wine, vinegar, sugar, garlic, and chicken broth until tender. The beef is then sliced, pan-fried for a crispy exterior, and served with a rich, reduced braising sauce. A vibrant, zesty Red Onion Gremolata (featuring finely chopped red onion, red jalape√±o, herbs, and lemon zest) adds a fresh, bright contrast to the rich braised beef. The dish can be prepared up to two days ahead.
