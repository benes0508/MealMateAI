This recipe creates a rich and creamy Chestnut and Potato Purée. It involves baking yellow-fleshed potatoes until tender, ricing them, and then combining them with chestnuts that have been simmered in half-and-half and butter, infused with bay leaf, and then puréed until smooth. The result is a comforting side dish with a unique blend of earthy chestnut and classic potato flavors.
