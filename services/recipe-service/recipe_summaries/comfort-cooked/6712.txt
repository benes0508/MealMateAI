This recipe details a **Cider-Brined Turkey** with a unique savory-sweet and aromatic profile. The turkey is brined overnight in a complex mixture of apple cider, kosher salt, soy sauce, brown sugar, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, garlic, shiitake mushrooms, and peppercorns. After brining, it's roasted with apples in the pan, with the resulting pan juices reduced to a flavorful **cider jus** to serve alongside.
