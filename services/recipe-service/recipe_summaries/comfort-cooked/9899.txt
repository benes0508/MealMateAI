This recipe provides instructions for making oven-baked French fries accompanied by three distinct homemade dipping sauces. The fries are prepared by par-boiling and then baking potato sticks until crispy. The three dips are: a Rosemary Mayonnaise, a Wasabi Crème Fraîche Dijon Mustard, and a Curry Ketchup, all requiring at least an hour of refrigeration for flavors to meld. Serving suggestions include individual decorative cones for the fries.
