This recipe details preparing a **Crown Roast of Pork with Corn Bread-Poblano Stuffing**, an impressive main course. The **pork roast** is first marinated overnight with olive oil, garlic, shallot, sage, salt, and pepper, then roasted at high heat before reducing to a lower temperature until cooked through. The accompanying **stuffing** is made by saut√©ing poblano chiles, onion, celery, and garlic, then combining them with corn bread, eggs, chicken stock, cilantro, and hot sauce. The stuffing is baked separately until golden, then the finished roast is presented upright on a bed of stuffing, with the center filled, ready to be carved at the table.
