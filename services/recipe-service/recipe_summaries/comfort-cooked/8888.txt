This recipe is for a hearty Beef Shank and Sausage Ragù with Whole Grain Spaghetti. It involves browning Italian sausage and beef shanks, then slow-braising them with diced tomatoes, red wine, onions, garlic, and spices (including fennel seeds and bay leaves) for 2.5 hours until the beef is very tender. The rich, reduced ragù is then served over whole grain spaghetti, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
