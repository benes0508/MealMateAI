This recipe details how to prepare mussels in a creamy green peppercorn sauce. Shallots are saut√©ed, then green peppercorns and white wine are added. Mussels are cooked in this liquid until they open, then transferred to bowls. Heavy cream and parsley are stirred into the remaining cooking liquid to form the sauce, which is spooned over the mussels.
