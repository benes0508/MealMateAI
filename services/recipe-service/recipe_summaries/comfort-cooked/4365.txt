This recipe details how to make a classic Chicken-Andouille Gumbo. It involves first simmering a whole chicken with aromatic vegetables and herbs to create a flavorful stock, then shredding the chicken. Separately, a dark roux is made, followed by saut√©ing the "holy trinity" (onion, bell pepper, celery) and garlic. The chicken stock, shredded chicken, browned andouille sausage, and additional herbs are added to the roux base and simmered until thickened. The gumbo is finished with hot sauce, seasoned, and served over white rice with scallions.
