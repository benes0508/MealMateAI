This recipe details how to make a **Sweet-Potato Cobbler** featuring a sweet, spiced sweet potato filling encased in a homemade pastry crust. Sweet potatoes are simmered with pure cane syrup, brown sugar, and spices, while a dough is prepared from flour, butter, and milk. The cobbler is assembled in a Dutch oven with layers of sweet potatoes and dough, then baked until golden, and served warm, optionally with vanilla ice cream.
