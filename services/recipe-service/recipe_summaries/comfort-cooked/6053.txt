This recipe provides instructions for making homemade French fries using a double-frying method for crispiness. Russet potatoes are peeled, cut into sticks, rinsed, dried, and then fried twice: first at 300°F until cooked through, then cooled, and finally at 375°F until golden brown. The fries are served immediately with salt and a selection of five dipping sauces: sour cream and onion, saffron mayonnaise, ginger sesame, roasted red pepper walnut, and chipotle tomatillo.
