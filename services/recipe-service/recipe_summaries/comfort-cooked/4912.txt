A hearty "Pork and Squash Stew with Chiles" featuring marinated, slow-cooked pork shoulder and a rich purée made from toasted New Mexico/guajillo and de árbol chiles, onion, and garlic. The stew is simmered for several hours until the pork is falling apart, then kabocha and delicata squash are added until tender. It's served garnished with fresh cilantro, toasted pumpkin seeds, and a quick pickled red onion and lime relish.
