This recipe for "My Favorite Roast Turkey" focuses on a multi-day preparation for an 18-20 pound bird. It involves a 24-hour brine with salt, lemons, honey, and herbs, followed by a 24-hour refrigerator air dry to ensure crispy skin. The turkey is then brushed with clarified butter, stuffed with aromatics like rosemary and garlic, and roasted at an initial 450°F until the thigh reaches 150°F, followed by a crucial 30-minute resting period.
