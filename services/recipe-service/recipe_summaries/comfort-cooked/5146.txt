This recipe details how to make a clear, flavorful **Basic Duck Stock**. It involves roasting duck or goose carcasses and other parts, along with optional pig or poultry feet, until well-browned. These are then simmered gently in cold water for several hours to extract flavor and collagen. Separately, aromatic vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, garlic) are roasted in the rendered duck fat. Finally, these roasted vegetables, along with dried mushrooms and various herbs and spices, are added to the simmering stock for a final cooking period. The stock is then carefully strained through a fine-mesh sieve and paper towel for clarity, seasoned, and can be refrigerated, frozen, or pressure-canned.
