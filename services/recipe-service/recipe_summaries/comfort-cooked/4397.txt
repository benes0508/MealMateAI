This recipe provides instructions for making a traditional chicken soup from scratch. It involves simmering chicken parts, a whole chicken, celery, onion, carrot, and parsnip to create a rich, strained broth. The cooked chicken is shredded and can be added back to the soup with sliced carrots, dill, and optional additions like egg noodles or matzo balls before serving.
