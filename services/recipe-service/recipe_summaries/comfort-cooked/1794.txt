"No-Frills Shrimp Boil" is a straightforward seafood boil featuring shell-on shrimp, red potatoes, and corn. The potatoes are boiled with Zatarain's/Old Bay seasoning, salt, and lemon until tender, then corn and shrimp are added and briefly poached off-heat. The dish is drained, served with an additional sprinkle of seasoning, a drizzle of olive oil, and lemon wedges.
