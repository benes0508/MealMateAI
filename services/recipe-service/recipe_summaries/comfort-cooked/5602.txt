This is an Ivory Carrot Soup, primarily made with white carrots and thickened with rice. The recipe involves saut√©ing white carrots, onion, rice, and seasonings (like thyme and a touch of sugar) before simmering in water or stock until tender. The soup is then pureed to a smooth, creamy consistency. It's served hot, garnished with finely diced, pre-cooked orange carrots and fresh carrot tops for a contrasting color and texture.
