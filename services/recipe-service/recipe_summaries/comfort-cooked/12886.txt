This recipe is for a hearty **Black Bean Soup**. It features dried black beans soaked and then simmered with **bacon**, onion, bell pepper, garlic, jalape√±o, and aromatic spices (oregano, bay leaf, thyme) in chicken broth until very tender. The soup is finished with fresh cilantro and served hot, typically garnished with sour cream, more fresh cilantro, and reserved crispy bacon pieces.
