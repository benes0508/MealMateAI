This recipe is for **Harira**, a Spiced Moroccan Vegetable Soup with Chickpeas, Cilantro, and Lemon. It features a base of saut√©ed onions, celery, and carrots, simmered with chickpeas, green lentils, crushed tomatoes, and stock. The soup is richly flavored with turmeric, cumin, and harissa (or red chile flakes), and brightened with fresh parsley, cilantro, and lemon juice. It's thickened with a unique flour-egg-lemon mixture and served garnished with fresh herbs, often with extra harissa on the side.
