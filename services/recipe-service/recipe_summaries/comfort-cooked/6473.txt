This recipe is for **White Sweet Potatoes with Mirin and Honey**, a dish featuring white sweet potatoes glazed with a sweet and savory sauce. The potatoes are partially pre-cooked (microwaved or baked), then sliced and tossed in a mixture of mirin, honey, vinegar, and salt. They are then baked in a hot cast-iron skillet until caramelized and tender. A simple pan sauce is made from the browned bits, water, and butter, and poured over the finished potatoes before serving.
