This recipe details how to make Creole Cream Cheese from skim milk, buttermilk, and a rennet tablet. The process involves warming the milk mixture, adding rennet, then letting it sit at room temperature for 48 hours to curdle. The solids are then strained through cheesecloth and hung in the refrigerator for 24 hours to drain, resulting in fresh cream cheese.
