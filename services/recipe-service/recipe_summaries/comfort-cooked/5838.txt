This recipe details how to make a **Mashed Potato and Cauliflower Gratin**. It involves boiling and mashing potatoes with milk, butter, Fontina, and pepper. Separately, cauliflower and garlic are boiled, then pureed with milk, butter, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. The two mixtures are combined, seasoned, transferred to a baking dish, brushed with butter, topped with more Parmigiano-Reggiano, baked until bubbly, and then broiled for a golden-brown finish.
