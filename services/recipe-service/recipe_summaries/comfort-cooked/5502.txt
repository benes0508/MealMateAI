Roast Proven√ßal Chicken is a flavorful whole chicken seasoned with a fragrant blend of garlic, herbes de Provence, and olive oil. It's oven-roasted using a two-stage temperature method to ensure crispy skin and tender meat. Served with lemon wedges, this dish can also be prepared up to two days in advance.
