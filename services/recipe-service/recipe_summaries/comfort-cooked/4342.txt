This recipe details how to prepare **Aleppo Pepper-Roasted Pork with Shallot Vinaigrette**. A bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt) is rubbed with a mixture of garlic, Aleppo pepper, salt, and brown sugar, then chilled for 12-24 hours. It's then slow-roasted at 300°F for 6-7 hours until it reaches 145°F. The dish is served with a vibrant vinaigrette made from shallots, red wine vinegar, parsley, marjoram/oregano, Aleppo pepper, and olive oil. Both the pork and vinaigrette can be prepared ahead of time.
