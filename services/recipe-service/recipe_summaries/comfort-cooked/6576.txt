Green Grits are a savory dish made by simmering grits with milk, water, salt, and pepper until thick. A vibrant green color is achieved by stirring in a pulsed mixture of fresh cilantro, diced green chiles, and green onions. The grits are finished with unsalted butter, sharp cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses, served hot.
