This recipe details **Peppercorn Roasted Pork with Vermouth Pan Sauce**. A boneless pork shoulder is prepared by stuffing and rubbing it with a paste of pink and black peppercorns, fennel seeds, and garlic, then marinated for 8-24 hours. The pork is roasted at 350Â°F until tender. A pan sauce is then made by deglazing the roasting pan with dry vermouth and chicken broth, reducing it, and thickening with a butter-flour mixture, finished with more pink peppercorns.
