This recipe details how to make a **Golden Potato Cake**, a savory dish resembling a potato gratin. Thinly sliced russet potatoes are pan-fried in ghee (or clarified butter) until browned, then layered in an oven-safe skillet with salt and pepper. The cake is initially cooked on the stovetop until tender, then baked in the oven until crisp and golden brown, and finally inverted onto a platter.
