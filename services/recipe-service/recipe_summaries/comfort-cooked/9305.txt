This recipe details a hearty Beef Stew featuring boneless beef chuck, potatoes, and carrots. The beef is first browned and then slow-braised in the oven for about 2.5 hours with a rich sauce made from saut√©ed aromatics (onions, celery, carrots, garlic), tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, dry red wine, beef broth, bay leaves, and thyme until fork-tender. After straining the solids, potatoes and additional carrots are added back to the liquid and simmered on the stovetop until tender. Serve with crusty bread.
