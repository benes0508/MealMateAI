This recipe features tender beef short ribs first seared and then slow-braised in a Dutch oven with a rich sauce flavored by Chinese five-spice powder, red wine, tomato paste, onion, and garlic until fall-off-the-bone tender. It's accompanied by a creamy carrot-parsnip purée, seasoned with milk, butter, and nutmeg. The strained braising liquid is reduced to create a flavorful sauce, which is served over the ribs and purée, garnished with fresh cilantro.
