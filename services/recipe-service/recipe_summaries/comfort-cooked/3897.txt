This recipe details how to make **Homemade Coconut Yogurt** from scratch. It involves blending unsweetened coconut flakes with hot water to create coconut milk, then combining a portion of this milk with pectin and heating. After cooling, the mixture is inoculated with live cultures from store-bought coconut yogurt and optionally vanilla, then poured into jars. These jars are cultured in a warm water bath (115Â°F) for 12-24 hours, and finally chilled to thicken.
