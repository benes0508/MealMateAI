This recipe is for a **no-bake Salted PB&J Ice Cream Pie** featuring a baked Ritz cracker and peanut crust. The filling is a rich, airy mixture of an egg-based peanut butter mousse folded with whipped cream. It's finished with grape jelly swirled on top before being frozen for at least 8 hours until firm enough to slice and serve.
