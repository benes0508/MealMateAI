This recipe for Sourdough Biscuits uses sourdough starter discard, flour, and butter to create tall, flaky biscuits. Dry ingredients are combined with chilled butter, then mixed gently with the sourdough starter. The dough is repeatedly folded and patted to build layers, then cut into biscuits, brushed with melted butter, and baked at 425Â°F for 12-15 minutes until golden and cooked through.
