This recipe for "Caramel Apple Cupcakes" details how to make moist apple-infused cupcakes, a light cream cheese frosting, and a homemade caramel sauce. The cupcakes involve creaming butter and sugar, adding eggs, alternating flour and hot water, and folding in grated apples before baking. The cream cheese frosting is made by beating butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and cream cheese until fluffy. The caramel sauce is prepared by dissolving sugar in water, then incorporating butter, vanilla, and heavy cream, cooked until golden and thickened upon cooling. The cupcakes are baked, cooled, and then ready to be frosted and topped with caramel.
