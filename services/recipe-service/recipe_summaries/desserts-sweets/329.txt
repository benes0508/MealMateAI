This is a recipe for Chocolate-Almond Fridge Fudge, a no-bake dessert. It's made by combining melted bittersweet chocolate with a pur√©e of avocado, maple syrup, and almond butter, along with cocoa powder and salt. The mixture is then poured into a pan, topped with toasted, crushed almonds and flaky sea salt, and chilled until firm before serving. It can be made up to a week in advance.
