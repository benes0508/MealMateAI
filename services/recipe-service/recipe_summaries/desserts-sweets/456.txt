This recipe details how to make **Vanilla Butter Anchovy Toasts**. It involves creating a sweet and savory vanilla-infused butter (unsalted butter, vanilla paste, vanilla extract, salt), toasting baguette slices, and then topping the warm toast with a thick layer of this vanilla butter, an oil-packed anchovy fillet, and fresh parsley. The vanilla butter can be prepared up to 5 days in advance.
