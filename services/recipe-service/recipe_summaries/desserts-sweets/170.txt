This recipe is for a **Strawberry-Rhubarb Crisp**. It features a sweet-tart fruit filling made with strawberries and rhubarb, coated in sugar, flour, and cornstarch. This is topped with a buttery, streusel-like mixture of flour, brown sugar, rolled oats, cornmeal, and cinnamon. The crisp is baked until golden and bubbling, then served warm.
