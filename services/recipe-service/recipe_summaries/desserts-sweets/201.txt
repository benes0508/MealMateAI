Grilled Pizza features a homemade yeast dough, cooked on the grill using direct and indirect heat for a crispy crust. It offers two distinct tomato sauce options: a quick blistered cherry tomato sauce with garlic and oregano, or a simple smooth canned tomato passata. Key toppings include a unique saut√©ed lemon-garlic Swiss chard mixture with Parmesan, along with mozzarella and Manchego cheeses. Optional pepperoni or soppressata can be added.
