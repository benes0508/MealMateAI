This recipe is for **Sourdough Key Lime Ricotta Cookies**, a dessert featuring a unique combination of leftover sourdough starter, creamy ricotta, and bright lime zest and juice. The cookies are prepared by creaming butter and sugar, incorporating the wet ingredients (including starter, ricotta, lime zest, and vanilla), then mixing in dry ingredients. The dough is chilled before being scooped and baked. A simple lime glaze is drizzled over the cooled cookies, which are then garnished with lime zest. They stay fresh for 3-5 days or can be frozen unglazed.
