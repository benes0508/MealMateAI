This recipe creates a refreshing **Frozen Avocado Cake** featuring a baked graham cracker crust and a smooth, no-bake filling. The filling combines avocado, cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, lemon, and lime juice, which is then spread over the cooled crust and **frozen for at least 6 hours** until firm. It's served chilled, often garnished with fresh lemon zest.
