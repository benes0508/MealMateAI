This recipe details a "Chicken and Potato Gratin With Brown Butter Cream." It involves searing seasoned chicken thighs and drumsticks, then baking them with potatoes and shallots in a rich brown butter cream infused with garlic, thyme, sage, and nutmeg. The gratin is finished with crispy, savory breadcrumbs made from day-old bread toasted in the chicken's pan drippings, resulting in a deeply flavorful and golden-brown dish.
