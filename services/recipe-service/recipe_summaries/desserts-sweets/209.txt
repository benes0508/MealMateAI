This recipe for **Camouflage Chocolate Fudge Brownies** creates fudgy, rich brownies with a unique marbled pattern. It involves preparing a deep chocolate brownie batter and two distinct cream cheese mixtures (one plain, one cocoa-infused). These are dolloped and swirled together with a reserved portion of the brownie batter before baking, resulting in a striking "camouflage" design. Key ingredients include Dutch process cocoa, butter, and full-fat cream cheese.
