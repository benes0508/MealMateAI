This recipe is for classic Tea Cakes, a small, round baked treat. They are made from a dough of flour, butter, sugar, eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla, spiced with nutmeg. The dough is chilled, rolled, cut into 1.5-inch rounds, topped with demerara sugar, and baked at 375Â°F for 8-10 minutes. The cakes can be stored for up to two weeks in an airtight container.
