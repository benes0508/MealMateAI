This recipe details how to make an Apple-Walnut Upside-Down Cake. It involves toasting walnuts, then caramelizing pre-cooked apple halves with butter and brown sugar directly in an oven-safe skillet. A cake batter is prepared by creaming butter and sugars, incorporating eggs, vanilla, a blend of ground walnuts, flour, and spices, and Greek yogurt. The batter is poured over the apple-caramel base in the skillet and baked until golden, then inverted for serving, typically with whipped cream and cinnamon.
