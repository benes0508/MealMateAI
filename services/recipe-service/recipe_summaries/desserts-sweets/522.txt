This recipe details how to make Apple-Honey-Pecan Muffins, featuring caramelized apples saut√©ed with butter, honey, and sea salt, and toasted pecans. The batter, made with a combination of all-purpose and spelt flours, olive oil, and buttermilk, is built on a base of whipped eggs for a light texture. Muffins are assembled by layering batter and apple slices, then topped with raw sugar and sea salt before baking. The batter can be prepared up to two days in advance.
