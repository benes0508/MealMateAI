Sourdough Crepes are thin, delicate pancakes featuring a tangy flavor from an overnight fermented sourdough starter. Made with flour, eggs, milk, and butter, they are quickly cooked in a pan. These versatile crepes can be served with both sweet toppings like jam or demerara sugar, or savory options such as lox. They are also suitable for make-ahead preparation, storing for up to 4 days refrigerated or 2 weeks frozen.
