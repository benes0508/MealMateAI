This recipe details how to make a classic **Lemon Meringue Pie**, featuring a vibrant lemon filling set in a blind-baked crust, topped with a fluffy, toasted meringue. The process involves cooking a smooth, tangy lemon custard with egg yolks and lemon juice, chilling it in the crust, then preparing a Swiss meringue with egg whites and sugar, which is piped onto the pie and lightly torched or broiled for a golden finish. The lemon filling can be made up to two days in advance.
