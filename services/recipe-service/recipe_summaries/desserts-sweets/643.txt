This recipe details how to make Cherry Biscuit Cobbler from scratch. It involves preparing a tender, lemony biscuit dough with butter and heavy cream, cutting out small biscuits, and chilling them. Concurrently, a sweet cherry filling is made with fresh or frozen cherries, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, and extracts. The filling is spread into a baking dish, topped with the chilled biscuits, brushed with butter, and sprinkled with raw sugar. The cobbler is then baked until the biscuits are golden brown and the cherry filling is bubbling, typically served warm with vanilla ice cream.
