A rich, savory-sweet Skillet Cornbread featuring rendered bacon fat and brown sugar. The simple batter, made with fine stone ground cornmeal, eggs, and buttermilk, is prepared by incorporating hot bacon fat from the cast-iron skillet before baking. Baked at 425Â°F for about 25 minutes until golden, it's served warm.
