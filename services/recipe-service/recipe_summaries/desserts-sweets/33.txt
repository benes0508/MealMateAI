**Chicken Pelau**

A flavorful Caribbean one-pot rice dish, featuring chicken, pigeon peas (or other beans like pinto or black-eyed), and vegetables cooked in a rich, caramelized sugar-infused liquid with coconut milk.

**Key Ingredients:** Chicken, rice, pigeon peas, onion, garlic, coconut milk, carrots, scallions, squash (calabaza/butternut), and a whole scotch bonnet pepper for flavor (removed before serving).

**Preparation:** The process involves caramelizing sugar in oil to build a flavorful base, browning the chicken, then simmering it with aromatics, coconut milk, and various seasonings. Pre-cooked peas, washed rice, and vegetables are then added and cooked until tender and the rice is fluffy and moist. The dish is noted for its adaptability with different meats (beef, lamb, crab) and bean types.
