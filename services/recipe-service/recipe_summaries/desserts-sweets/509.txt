This recipe is for an Olive Oil Apple Cake, a moist loaf cake featuring grated and dried sweet apples, mild extra virgin olive oil, and a unique blend of spices including cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, and ginger. The cake is topped with a spiced sugar mixture before baking and can be made up to three days in advance, as its flavor improves over time.
