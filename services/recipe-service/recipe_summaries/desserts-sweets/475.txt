Buttery Bejeweled Rice is an aromatic and colorful pilaf. Long-grain rice is cooked with butter, garlic, and warming spices like cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, and a hint of red pepper. It's generously topped with sweetened carrots, toasted almonds and pistachios, butter-plumped dried fruits (golden raisins, tart cherries, cranberries), and fresh scallion greens, creating a rich, sweet-savory side dish with varied textures and a vibrant presentation.
