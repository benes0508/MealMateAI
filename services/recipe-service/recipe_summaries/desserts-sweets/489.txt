This recipe is for Iranian Rice Cookies featuring brown butter, rose water, and ground cardamom for distinct flavor. The dough combines all-purpose and white rice flours, with balls shaped and imprinted (traditionally with a meat mallet) before baking at 350Â°F for 16-18 minutes until lightly golden.
