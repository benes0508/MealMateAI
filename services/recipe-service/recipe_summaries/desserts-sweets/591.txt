This recipe for "Mix-and-Match Fools" describes a simple, no-cook dessert. It involves whipping heavy cream with sugar, vanilla, and salt until soft peaks form. Separately, berries are macerated with sugar and salt until juicy. Finally, the macerated berries are gently folded into the whipped cream until just combined, creating a streaky mixture, and served in glasses. Both components can be prepared a couple of hours in advance.
