This recipe details how to make Instant Pot Lemon Vanilla Rice Pudding. Arborio rice is pressure-cooked with milk, sugar, lemon zest, vanilla bean, and a cinnamon stick. After cooking, cream and egg yolks are whisked in to thicken the pudding using the residual heat. The pudding is then chilled for at least 4 hours and can be served with optional raisins, ground cinnamon, and whipped cream.
