This Christmas Cake recipe features a rich blend of dried fruits (raisins, currants, dates) and slivered almonds, soaked overnight in brandy for enhanced flavor. The cake batter combines creamed butter and brown sugar with eggs, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and allspice. It's baked slowly at 140°C (275°F) for 2 hours, then a final touch of brandy is spooned over while warm. This traditional cake is designed for long storage, keeping well in an airtight container for up to 2 months.
