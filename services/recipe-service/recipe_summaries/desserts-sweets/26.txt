Miso-Squash Ramen is a flavorful ramen dish featuring roasted kabocha or butternut squash. The squash is glazed with miso, maple syrup, and soy sauce, then roasted until caramelized. A creamy broth is made by blending vegetable broth with ginger, garlic, miso, and some of the roasted squash. The ramen is served with cooked noodles, crisp-tender broccolini, reserved roasted squash pieces, and fresh cilantro.
