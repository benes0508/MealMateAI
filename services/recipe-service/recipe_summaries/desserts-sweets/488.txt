These Pastel Butter Cookies are delicate almond-flavored butter cookies made with finely ground blanched almonds. After baking, they are uniquely coated in homemade, vibrantly colored, pastel glazes created by blending freeze-dried fruits (such as blueberries, raspberries, and mangoes) with confectioners' sugar.
