This recipe is for a "Killer Chocolate Cake," featuring a rich, moist chocolate cake made with both cocoa powder and melted chocolate, combined with a smooth chocolate frosting that includes a surprising touch of soy sauce for added depth of flavor. The cake is baked in a 9x13-inch pan, and the frosting is whipped and spread over the cooled cake. It can be stored refrigerated for up to 3 days.
