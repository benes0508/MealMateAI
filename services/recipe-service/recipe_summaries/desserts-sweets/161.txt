Classic BBQ Baked Beans are prepared by cooking diced bacon, onion, and red bell pepper in a Dutch oven on a grill. Kidney beans are added, followed by a rich sauce made from brown sugar, ketchup, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, molasses, mustard, hot sauce, and Creole seasoning. The beans are then simmered, covered, until thickened and tender.
