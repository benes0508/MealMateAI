This recipe details how to prepare a Spiral Ham in the Slow Cooker. A bone-in, fully cooked ham is slow-cooked with parsnips and carrots, bathed in a sweet and tangy liquid of maple syrup, apple juice, and brown sugar. After cooking, the ham is sliced off the bone and served with the vegetables, drizzled with a sauce made from the cooking liquid, Dijon mustards, and apple cider vinegar.
