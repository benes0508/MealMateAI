This recipe details how to make **Whole Wheat-Oat Waffles** served with a homemade **blueberry-lemon syrup**. The syrup is prepared by simmering blueberries with lemon zest and sugar, then thickening with cornstarch. The waffle batter combines whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder, and baking soda with yogurt, melted butter, and an egg. Waffles are cooked in a waffle iron until golden brown and served warm with the prepared syrup and butter.
