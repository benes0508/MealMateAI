This "No-Churn Fresh Mint and Chocolate Ice Cream" recipe allows for homemade ice cream without an ice cream maker. It features fresh mint-infused cream, whipped and folded with sweetened condensed milk and Dutch process cocoa, then layered with melted bittersweet chocolate. The mixture is frozen until solid, and can be prepared up to a week in advance.
