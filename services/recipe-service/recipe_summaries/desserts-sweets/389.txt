This is a savory One-Pot Pie featuring a unique cornmeal and Parmesan crust. It's filled with layers of a vibrant, spicy callaloo mixture and a sweet plantain and corn saut√©. These are combined with mozzarella, goat cheese, and Parmesan, all brought together by a rich white wine and cream sauce. The pie is assembled in layers, topped with a second crust, egg-washed, and baked until golden brown.
