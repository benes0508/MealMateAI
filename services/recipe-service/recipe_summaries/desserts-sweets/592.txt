This recipe is for a no-bake Frozen Margarita Pie, featuring a graham cracker crust and a creamy filling made with sweetened condensed milk, lime juice and zest, and tequila blanco. The filling is gently folded with whipped cream to create a light, airy texture, then frozen until set, requiring at least 8 hours of chill time. It can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
