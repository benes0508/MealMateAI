This recipe details how to make savory Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits. Key ingredients include flour, cold butter, sour cream, and fresh scallions, along with baking powder and soda for leavening. The process involves mixing dry ingredients, cutting in butter, adding scallions, then incorporating sour cream to form a shaggy dough. The dough is then folded multiple times to create flaky layers before being cut into squares, brushed with melted butter, and baked until golden brown. Serve warm, optionally with more sour cream.
