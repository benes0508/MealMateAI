Spicy Chickpea Poppers are crispy fried chickpeas coated in a flavorful spice blend and a garlic confit sauce. The recipe involves making a smooth garlic-fish sauce confit, preparing a finely ground spice mixture (with ingredients like Sichuan peppercorns, chile flakes, cumin, and five-spice), and breading chickpeas with a buttermilk-flour batter. The breaded chickpeas are then deep-fried until golden and crispy, tossed with the garlic sauce, fried basil, and the prepared spice mix, then served immediately.
