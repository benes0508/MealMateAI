This Cardamom-Pistachio Bûche de Noël is an elaborate holiday dessert featuring a light sponge cake rolled with a creamy pistachio filling and brushed with a cardamom-brandy syrup. The cake is then frosted with a rich chocolate buttercream to resemble a tree log, decorated with homemade chocolate bark shards, delicate meringue mushrooms, and ground pistachios for "moss," finished with a dusting of powdered sugar.
