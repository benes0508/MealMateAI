"Tahini Billionaire Bars" are a decadent dessert featuring a three-layer construction. They start with a buttery, crisp shortbread base infused with toasted sesame seeds. This is topped with a rich, smooth tahini-infused butterscotch caramel. The bars are finished with a layer of bittersweet chocolate, often garnished with more sesame seeds. The preparation involves baking the shortbread, then layering the butterscotch and chocolate, followed by chilling to set before slicing into small squares. They can be made ahead and stored at room temperature.
