This recipe is for an "Any Berry Galette," a rustic fruit tart featuring a filling of berries (like strawberries), sugar, lemon zest and juice, cornstarch, and vanilla extract, all encased in a flaky pastry dough. The galette is baked until golden brown and bubbly, then cooled and optionally served with whipped cream or ice cream.
