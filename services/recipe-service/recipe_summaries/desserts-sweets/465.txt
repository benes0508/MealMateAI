This Banana Cream Pie features a homemade crust crafted from crushed graham crackers, salted peanuts, and butter, then baked until golden. The creamy filling is a cooked custard made with sugar, cornstarch, eggs, milk, vanilla, and butter, combined with sliced ripe bananas. This is poured into the cooled crust and chilled until set. The pie is finished with a topping of freshly whipped cream and a garnish of chopped salted peanuts.
