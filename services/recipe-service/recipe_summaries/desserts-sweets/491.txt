This recipe is for **Lebkuchen (German Honey Bars)**, a traditional German spiced cookie or bar. It features a rich, honey-sweetened dough infused with a blend of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, and anise, along with lemon zest, candied citron, orange peel, and almonds. The dough requires significant refrigeration (24 hours to a month) before being baked as a slab, then glazed with a lemon icing, and cut into bars. The Lebkuchen are noted to improve in flavor with aging (up to 2 weeks) and have a long shelf life.
