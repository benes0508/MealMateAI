This recipe creates a dessert featuring salted pistachio crumbles, honey-cardamom macerated strawberries, and ice cream. The crumbles are made by toasting and processing pistachios, then mixing them with flour, sugar, cornmeal, salt, and melted butter before baking until golden. Strawberries are tossed with lemon juice, cardamom, salt, and warm honey until juicy. The dish is assembled by scooping ice cream, topping with the strawberries and their juices, and scattering the pistachio crumbles over.
