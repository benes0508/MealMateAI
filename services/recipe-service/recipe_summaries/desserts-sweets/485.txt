This recipe details how to make **Goat Butter Shortbread** cookies. It features goat butter for a distinct flavor, combined with granulated sugar, unbleached all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, toasted wheat germ, and two types of salt. The dough is prepared by first chilling the butter and sugar, then incorporating dry ingredients, mixing until just combined, and rolling it thin between parchment paper. After chilling, the dough is docked, cut into rectangular shapes, and baked at 325Â°F until firm and lightly browned. The shortbread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.
