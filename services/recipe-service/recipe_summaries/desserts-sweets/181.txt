These Trail Mix Cookies are a chewy, customizable treat packed with toasted nuts, seeds, oats, dried fruit, and chocolate. The recipe involves toasting the dry mix-ins for enhanced flavor, combining them with a standard cookie dough base (flour, butter, sugars, egg, vanilla, salt, baking soda), and then chilling the dough for at least two hours to achieve a chewier texture. Cookies are pressed into disks, sprinkled with sea salt, and baked until golden. They are perfect for making ahead and storing at room temperature.
