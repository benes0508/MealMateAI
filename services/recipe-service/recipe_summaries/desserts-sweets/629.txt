This Coconut Rice Pudding Pie features a baked crust made from ground sesame sticks, sugar, and butter. It's filled with a creamy, gelatin-set rice pudding cooked with coconut milk, heavy cream, eggs, and jasmine rice. A layer of homemade coconut milk and dark brown sugar caramel lines the crust. The pie is topped with rum-infused whipped cream and toasted coconut flakes, requiring multiple chilling steps for setting.
