Syrniki are traditional pan-fried farmer's cheese patties. Made by combining farmer's cheese (tvorog) with egg yolks, sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt, the mixture is shaped into small, floured patties and cooked in butter and oil until golden brown. They are typically served immediately with sour cream.
