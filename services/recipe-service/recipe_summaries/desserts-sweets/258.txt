Satay Lettuce Wraps feature ground chicken/turkey and a mix of vegetables (bell pepper, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, jicama, celery, green onions) tossed in a flavorful sauce made with coconut aminos, almond butter, honey/maple syrup, sesame oil, and sriracha. The filling is cooked and served in lettuce cups, garnished with cashews and sesame/hemp seeds.
