These Nut Butter Granola Bars are a make-ahead friendly recipe featuring toasted nuts and pumpkin seeds, old-fashioned oats, and dried fruit, all bound together by a cooked honey-vanilla-salt syrup mixed with natural peanut butter and an egg white. The mixture is pressed firmly into a pan, baked until golden brown, and then cooled before being cut into individual bars.
