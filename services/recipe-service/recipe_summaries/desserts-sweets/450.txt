This recipe details preparing a **Spiced Pomegranate and Orange Glazed Ham**. A large ham leg is scored, de-rinded, and coated with a rich, syrupy glaze made from pomegranate molasses, orange juice, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, and star anise. Orange slices are arranged on top, and the ham is roasted until golden and caramelized, basted frequently with the aromatic glaze.
