Buss Up Shut, also known as Paratha Roti, is a Caribbean-style flaky, shredded flatbread. It's prepared from a soft, sticky dough made with flour, milk powder, baking powder, and sugar, mixed gently without kneading. A unique folding technique, incorporating a shortening-ghee mixture, creates its distinctive layers. The roti is cooked on a griddle until golden and bubbly, then "buss up" (shredded) with spatulas while hot to achieve its characteristic soft, flaky, and open texture, resembling a torn shirt.
