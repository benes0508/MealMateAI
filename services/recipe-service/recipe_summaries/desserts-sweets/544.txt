This recipe is for "Salty-Sweet Fall Cookies," a dessert that combines a chewy cookie base with the crunch of chopped chocolate-covered pretzels mixed into the dough. After baking, the cookies are drizzled with melted milk chocolate and garnished with more pretzels, creating a balance of sweet and salty flavors.
