This recipe for Sumac and Vanilla Shortbread features a unique blend of sweet vanilla and tangy sumac. It involves processing butter, confectioners' sugar, flour, vanilla seeds, and salt into a dough. The dough is then shaped into logs, rolled in a sumac-granulated sugar mix, and chilled. Finally, the logs are sliced and baked at 190°C/375°F for 10-12 minutes until light golden.
