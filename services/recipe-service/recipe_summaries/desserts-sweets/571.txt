This recipe details how to make an "Extra-Flaky Pastry Dough" using flour, sugar, salt, butter, and ice water. Its signature flakiness comes from incorporating large, rectangular pieces of chilled butter into the flour mixture, then repeatedly rolling and folding the dough (similar to a rough puff pastry method) to create numerous thin layers. The dough is then chilled before being rolled out for use and can be prepared ahead of time or frozen.
