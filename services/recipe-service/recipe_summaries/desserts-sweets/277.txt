This recipe details how to make **Cinnamon Sugar Sourdough Waffles** using leftover sourdough starter. The batter is prepared by combining the starter with milk, melted butter, egg, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cooked waffles are then brushed with butter and pressed into a cinnamon-sugar mixture for a sweet, spiced coating. They are typically served topped with fresh pineapple, mixed berries, coconut flakes, and maple syrup. The waffles can also be frozen for up to two months.
