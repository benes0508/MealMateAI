This is a recipe for **Salt-and-Pepper Fish**, featuring pan-fried cod generously seasoned with salt, black pepper, and ginger. It's served over tender sushi rice, which is enhanced with rice vinegar, sugar, and butter. Scallions are utilized in two ways: the white and pale green parts are caramelized with the fish, while the dark green tops are mixed into the seasoned rice, offering a fresh, aromatic finish to this savory and slightly tangy meal.
