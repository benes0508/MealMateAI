This recipe details a Whipped Cream Cake, a light and delicate cake that uniquely incorporates whipped heavy cream directly into the batter along with eggs, superfine sugar, and flour. Baked in a fluted tube pan, this method yields a tender and moist cake, typically served simply with a dusting of powdered sugar or an additional dollop of whipped cream.
