This recipe details a Fresh Fruit Tart with an almond press-in crust. The dessert features a buttery, golden-brown crust made from all-purpose and almond flour, sugar, and egg yolks. It's filled with a smooth, vanilla-infused custard, thickened with cornstarch and enriched with butter, then topped generously with fresh blueberries and blackberries. Both the crust and custard can be prepared ahead of time.
