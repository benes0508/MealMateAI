This recipe details a **Backyard Citrus Upside-Down Cake**, specifically using **lemons** for a bitter and tart flavor. It features a unique preparation where a melted butter and sugar layer is frozen in the pan, then topped with macerated lemon slices before the cake batter is poured over. The cake is baked until golden, then inverted to reveal the caramelized citrus topping. It's adaptable to various citrus fruits, excluding raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime.
