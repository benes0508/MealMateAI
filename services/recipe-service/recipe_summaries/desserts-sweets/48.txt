This recipe features **Papaya-and-Cubeb-Marinated Snapper** served with **Baked Yam Chips**. Snapper fillets are scored and infused with a unique marinade made from fresh papaya, aromatic cubeb pepper, cilantro, red onion, garlic, ginger, and bird chiles, then broiled until crisp. Accompanying the snapper are yam chips, prepared by soaking in sugared salt water to counter bitterness, then seasoned and oven-roasted to a crispy golden finish. The dish is garnished with fresh papaya ribbons, cilantro, and served with lemon wedges and shito.
