This recipe for "Shockingly Easy No-Knead Focaccia" simplifies bread-making by requiring no kneading. It involves mixing yeast, honey, flour, and salt into a shaggy dough, followed by a crucial long cold fermentation (8-24 hours). After a second rise at room temperature, the dough is dimpled, drizzled with olive oil, and baked until golden. A final touch of melted garlic butter is brushed over the warm focaccia.
