Pajeon, or Korean Scallion Pancakes, are savory, pan-fried pancakes made from a light batter of flour, cornstarch, ice-cold club soda, egg yolk, garlic, and doenjang (fermented soybean paste), generously mixed with cut scallions. Cooked until crisp and golden brown, they are typically served in quarters with pajeon sauce.
