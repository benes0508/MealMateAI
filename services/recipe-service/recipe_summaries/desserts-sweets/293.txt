This recipe details a "Swirl Spice Cake," a moist loaf cake featuring a streusel made with pecans, a savory-to-sweet coffee spice mix, brown sugar, and butter. The cake batter itself incorporates sour cream for richness. The streusel is layered and swirled into the batter before baking. It's finished with a simple orange juice and powdered sugar glaze, and can be prepared up to three days in advance.
