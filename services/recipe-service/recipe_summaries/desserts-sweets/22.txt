Chhena Poda is an Indian baked cheesecake made primarily from paneer (Indian cheese) and semolina, spiced with cardamom, and often includes cashews and golden raisins. A distinguishing feature is the caramelized sugar layer formed at the bottom of the pan, which becomes the top when flipped, similar to a flan or upside-down cake. It's typically served chilled.
