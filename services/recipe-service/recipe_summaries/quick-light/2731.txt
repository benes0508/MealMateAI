Everyday Yellow Dal is a comforting Indian lentil dish made with moong dal, simmered until creamy with turmeric and seasoned with salt. The recipe offers two tarka (tempering) options: a simple version with ghee, cumin, onion, and red chiles, or a more elaborate one that adds fennel, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and green chiles for deeper flavor. The dish is traditionally garnished with fresh cilantro and served with lime wedges.
