This recipe details how to make **Skillet Hash Browns** by coarsely shredding russet potatoes, rinsing, and pressing out excess liquid. The seasoned potatoes are cooked in a nonstick skillet with oil in two layers, sprinkled with scallion whites in between, then pressed into an even layer. After cooking until golden brown on one side (10-15 mins), they are flipped and cooked until golden on the other side. Finished with a sprinkle of sea salt and scallion greens, they are served in wedges. A "do ahead" note mentions they can be kept warm in a 200Â°F oven for up to an hour.
