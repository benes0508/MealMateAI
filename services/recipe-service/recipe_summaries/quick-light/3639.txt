This Spanish-Style Tomato Toast features a savory blend of grated ripe tomatoes, fresh garlic rubbed on toast, and a distinctive olive oil infused with finely chopped anchovies. Crusty bread is toasted, flavored with garlic and the anchovy oil, then topped with the fresh tomato pulp and smoked sea salt for a simple yet flavorful appetizer or light bite.
