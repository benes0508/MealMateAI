"Pasta e Ceci con Vongole" is a hearty Italian-inspired soup featuring chickpeas (ceci) and clams (vongole). Dried garbanzo beans are soaked, boiled, then simmered with olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and red pepper until tender, with a portion pureed to thicken the broth. Clams are cooked with garlic in a separate skillet, their meat removed, and the strained clam juices are added to the chickpea mixture along with ditalini pasta. The soup is cooked until the pasta is tender, then the clams are stirred in and seasoned to taste before serving.
