This recipe is for a Spiced and Sour Mushroom Soup (Tom Yam Hed). It's a quick, flavorful broth made with vegetable stock, shallots, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and chiles, boiled with oyster and straw mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. It's finished off-heat with miso paste, lime juice, and a touch of apple concentrate or honey.
