Easter Lamb Soup, also known as Magiritsa, is a traditional Greek soup made with lamb offal (head, neck, intestines, liver). It involves simmering lamb to create a rich stock and tender meat, blanching and finely chopping intestines, then saut√©ing the liver with scallions and chili. The cooked meat, intestines, and liver are combined with the strained lamb stock and finished with a creamy, tangy egg-lemon (Avgolemono) sauce. Fresh dill is a key aromatic. The recipe notes options for adding rice, or using chicken/meatless alternatives.
