This recipe prepares a classic Shrimp Po'Boy. Shrimp are seasoned with a blend of Cajun-style spices, dipped in buttermilk, and coated in a flour-cornmeal mixture before being deep-fried until golden. The crispy shrimp are then served in long French rolls with r√©moulade sauce, shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and dill pickles.
