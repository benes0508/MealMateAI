This recipe details how to prepare Seared Salmon with Linguine and a homemade Ramp Pesto. It involves first making the pesto by saut√©ing ramp bulbs, then blending them with green ramp tops, Asiago cheese, Marcona almonds, tarragon, and olive oil. Linguine is cooked, and salmon fillets are pan-seared until opaque. The dish is assembled by tossing the cooked pasta with most of the pesto, topping it with seared salmon, and garnishing with the remaining pesto.
