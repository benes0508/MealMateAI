This recipe prepares a Glazed Ham with Pineapple Mustard Sauce. An 8-10 lb partially cooked smoked shank end ham is trimmed, then initially baked in a roasting pan with pineapple juice. A key component is the two-part pineapple mustard sauce: pineapple juice is reduced with sugar, then whisked with Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Half of this mixture is combined with fresh thyme and used as a glaze for basting the ham during the final uncovered bake, ensuring a golden finish and rich flavor. The ham is cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 145-150Â°F. After resting, it is sliced and served with the reserved pineapple mustard mixture on the side.
