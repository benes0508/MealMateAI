This recipe details how to prepare a "Fully Salted Roast Chicken." It involves generously salting a whole 3-4lb chicken, inside and out, then chilling it uncovered for 8-24 hours. After letting it come to room temperature, the chicken is roasted at 425°F for 40-55 minutes until it reaches 165°F, followed by a 15-minute rest. The only ingredients are chicken and kosher salt.
