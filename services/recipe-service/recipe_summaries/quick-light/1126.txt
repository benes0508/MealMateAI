This recipe features pan-fried, turmeric-seasoned pork loin cutlets served over vermicelli rice noodles tossed in a creamy, zesty basil-cashew-lime sauce. Charred green beans are added alongside, and the dish is garnished with fresh mint, roasted cashews, and lime wedges for a savory, fresh, and slightly spicy bowl.
