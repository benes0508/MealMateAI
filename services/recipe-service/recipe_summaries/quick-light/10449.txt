This recipe features a 12-14 lb turkey seasoned and coated in mole sauce, then refrigerated. The turkey is filled with masa stuffing (extra baked separately) and roasted, initially at high heat then lower, covered and uncovered, with frequent basting, until 170Â°F. A chile gravy is made from the roasting pan drippings with a roux, lime juice, and chile powder. The dish is served with the gravy and reheated reserved mole sauce.
