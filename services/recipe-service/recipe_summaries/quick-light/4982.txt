This recipe details how to create elegant dessert cups using phyllo dough. Phyllo sheets are buttered, sugared, shaped into muffin cups, and baked until crisp. These crispy "flowers" are then filled with cool raspberry sorbet and topped with a homemade blueberry mixture, made from cooked frozen blueberries (thickened to a syrup) and fresh blueberries.
