This recipe outlines how to make crispy **Roasted Russet Potato Wedges** by tossing them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roasting them at a high temperature (500Â°F). The wedges are initially roasted covered, then uncovered and flipped, to achieve tenderness and a golden finish. A simple **rosemary butter sauce** is prepared simultaneously to be drizzled over the hot potatoes before serving.
