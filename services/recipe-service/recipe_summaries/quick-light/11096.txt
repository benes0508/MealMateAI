This recipe for Peel-and-Eat Hot Pepper Shrimp features large, unpeeled shrimp steeped in a spicy, aromatic broth. The broth is prepared by simmering Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles, green onions, thyme, garlic, bay leaf, and allspice in water. Once the broth is flavorful, shrimp are added, brought to a boil, then removed from heat to cook through for 20 minutes. The liquid is drained, and the shrimp are served warm or at room temperature for diners to peel.
