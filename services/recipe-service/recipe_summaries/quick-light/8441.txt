This recipe features sautéed shrimp and xuxu (chayote) combined with hearts of palm and fresh cilantro. The dish is brought to life with a vibrant, uncooked chile-lemon sauce, made from finely chopped garlic, onion, jalapeño, and lemon juice, which is stirred in at the end for a fresh, zesty finish.
