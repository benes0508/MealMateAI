This recipe is for **Toasted Almond and Pecorino Sandwiches**. It involves creating a coarse paste from toasted whole almonds, olive oil, lemon juice and peel, fresh sage, salt, and pepper. This paste is spread on country-style bread slices, topped with thin slices of Pecorino cheese, and then covered with another bread slice. The sandwiches are brushed with olive oil and cooked in a nonstick skillet until golden brown and crusty on both sides.
