This recipe is for Balsamic-Glazed Pork Chops. It involves pan-searing seasoned pork chops and quartered shallots until browned, then deglazing the pan with balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper to create a syrupy glaze. The pork chops are returned to the pan to finish cooking and coat with the sauce, which is then boiled to further thicken before serving.
