This recipe for Hasselback Carrots involves steaming 3-inch carrot pieces until tender, then cutting flat surfaces and searing them in a hot skillet until blackened. The carrots are then partially sliced crosswise to fan out, and finished with a drizzle of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, flaky sea salt, and sliced chives.
