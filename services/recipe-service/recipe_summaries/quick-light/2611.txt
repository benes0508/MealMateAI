Carla's Tomato Soup is a flavorful, smooth tomato soup featuring San Marzano tomatoes, shallots, fennel, smoked paprika, and butter. The vegetables are first softened and spiced, then simmered with tomatoes before being pur√©ed until creamy. It's served with thick slices of country-style bread, pan-fried in olive oil until golden and seasoned with flaky sea salt. The soup can be prepared up to three days in advance.
