This recipe details how to make Perfect Fish Tacos featuring deep-fried, battered white fish (like red snapper). The fish is coated in a thin pancake-like batter made from all-purpose flour, rice flour, and club soda, then fried at 350°F until golden and crisp. Corn tortillas are warmed and then topped with the fried fish, cabbage and jicama slaw, hot sauce, avocado, cilantro, and pickled jalapeños, served with lime wedges.
