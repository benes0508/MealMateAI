This recipe features carrots prepared in two ways: thinly sliced carrots pickled in a sweet and spicy vinegar solution, and small carrots sautéed with garlic and butter until tender. Both are served over a creamy purée made from pan-toasted almonds blended with olive oil, vinegar, and sugar, then garnished with fresh cilantro, mint, and toasted sesame seeds.
