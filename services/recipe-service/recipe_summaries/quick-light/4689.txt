**Tortilla Espa√±ola** is a classic Spanish potato and egg omelet. It involves caramelizing onions and cooking diced potatoes in olive oil until tender. The cooked onions and potatoes are then combined with beaten eggs and a portion of the cooking oil, which is then cooked in a non-stick skillet until set, flipped, and cooked briefly on the other side, then cut into wedges.
