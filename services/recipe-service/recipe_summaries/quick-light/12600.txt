This recipe details making classic Belgian Fries with a homemade Sauce Andalouse. The fries are prepared from russet potatoes using a precise two-stage deep-frying method (first at 300°F to cook through, then at 375°F to crisp and brown) after soaking and drying. The accompanying Sauce Andalouse is a creamy, savory dip made with mayonnaise, tomato paste, finely chopped onion, bell peppers, and fresh lemon juice, which is chilled before serving.
