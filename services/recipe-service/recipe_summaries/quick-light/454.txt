Smoked Trout Croquettes are savory, deep-fried bites made from a creamy mashed potato base mixed with flaky smoked trout, Parmesan, mozzarella, fresh chives, and a hint of horseradish. These small, flavorful balls are coated in panko breadcrumbs for a crispy exterior and are ideal as an appetizer or side, served with lemon wedges. They can also be prepared ahead of time.
