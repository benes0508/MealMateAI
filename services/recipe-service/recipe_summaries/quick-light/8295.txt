A unique, sweet-tart Cranberry Sauce featuring red wine, pomegranate molasses, and a blend of Mediterranean herbs (basil, cilantro, and mint). It's made by reducing a wine-sugar syrup before cooking cranberries, then incorporating the distinct flavorings. This recipe is notably designed for make-ahead preparation.
