This recipe for **Carciofi alla Giudea (Fried Artichokes, Jewish-style)** details how to prepare and deep-fry baby artichokes until crispy and tender. The process involves trimming and blanching artichokes, pressing their leaves open, then deep-frying them in two stages: first briefly to set the leaves, then until the hearts are tender. They are seasoned with salt and served with fresh lemon wedges.
