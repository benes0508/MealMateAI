This recipe provides instructions for making five loaves of **Basic Pull-Apart Challah**. It involves blooming yeast, kneading a dough made from flour, sugar, salt, egg yolks, and canola oil, and then allowing it to rise twice for approximately one hour each time. The dough is then divided, shaped into small balls, and arranged in round baking pans. Before baking, the challahs are brushed with an egg wash and topped with sesame or poppy seeds, then baked at 375°F and then 350°F until dark golden brown.
