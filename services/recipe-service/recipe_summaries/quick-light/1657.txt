This recipe prepares a boneless, butterflied leg of lamb, generously seasoned and rubbed with a aromatic blend of coarsely ground fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, and garlic. The lamb is first seared to a golden brown, then roasted to medium-rare alongside carrots, which are cooked using the rendered lamb fat. A vibrant salsa verde is made from finely chopped reserved carrot tops, parsley, chives, lemon juice, and pan drippings. The dish is served with sliced, rested lamb, warm roasted carrots, and the fresh, herbaceous salsa verde.
