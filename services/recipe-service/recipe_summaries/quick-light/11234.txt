Tofu Rigatoni Casserole is a baked pasta dish featuring rigatoni, spinach, and a homemade tomato sauce. It utilizes blended tofu, egg, and spices to create a creamy, ricotta-like binder, which is combined with the pasta, sauce, and some mozzarella and Parmesan, then topped with more cheese and baked until golden and bubbling.
