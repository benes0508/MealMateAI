A quick, grilled flatbread recipe similar to pita bread. This recipe uses a simple yeast dough that requires minimal kneading and a very short 10-minute rest. The dough is rolled thin and cooked on a hot grill pan or skillet for about 2 minutes per side until grill marks appear and it's cooked through.
