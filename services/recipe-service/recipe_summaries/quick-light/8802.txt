A refreshing appetizer or light bite, Salmon and Cucumber Boats feature a savory filling of smoked salmon, diced tomato, green onions, fresh basil, and orange sections (including zest and juice). This mixture is spooned into halved, seeded cucumbers, then topped with reduced-fat sour cream and served with pumpernickel or whole wheat bread.
