A refreshing and quick-to-prepare cold noodle salad featuring quick-cooked shrimp, brown rice spaghetti, and a colorful mix of julienned cucumber, carrots, and radishes. It's tossed in a vibrant Asian-inspired dressing made from tamari (for a gluten-friendly option), rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, honey, garlic, and Sriracha. Topped with sesame seeds, this dish offers a delightful balance of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors.
