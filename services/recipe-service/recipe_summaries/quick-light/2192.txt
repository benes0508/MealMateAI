This recipe details how to make homemade American cheese using grated mild orange cheese (like Colby), milk, gelatin, butter, and salt. The process involves blooming gelatin, heating milk and butter, then blending these with processed cheese and salt in a food processor until smooth. The mixture is then poured into a prepared mold (for blocks or slices), chilled until firm, and can be stored for up to 5 days.
