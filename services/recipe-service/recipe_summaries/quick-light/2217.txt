This recipe features a rich Wild Mushroom and Parsnip Ragout served over creamy Cheesy Polenta. The ragout is made by saut√©ing onions, garlic, thyme, and parsnips, then browning wild mushrooms, and simmering them in a flavorful sauce with miso, tomato paste, and red wine until thickened. Quick-cooking polenta is prepared with milk and salt, then finished with Parmesan cheese. The dish is assembled by topping the cheesy polenta with the mushroom ragout, more Parmesan, and chopped roasted hazelnuts.
