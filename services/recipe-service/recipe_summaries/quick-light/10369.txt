This recipe features a rich **Wild Mushroom Ragoût** served atop **Crispy Polenta squares** and finished with grated **Comté Cheese**. The polenta is cooked with milk and broth, infused with a bay leaf, then mixed with Comté and butter, pressed into a sheet, chilled, and cut into squares before being pan-fried until crispy. The mushroom ragout consists of sautéed assorted wild mushrooms and shallots, deglazed with balsamic vinegar, then simmered with chicken broth and crème fraîche. The dish is assembled by topping the crispy polenta with the warm mushroom ragout, fresh parsley, and additional Comté cheese.
