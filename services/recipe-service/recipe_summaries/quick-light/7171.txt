Bagna Cauda Dip with Assorted Vegetables is a warm, savory Italian dipping sauce. This rich, aromatic dip is made by simmering garlic until tender, then mashing it and combining it with melted butter, chopped anchovies, and olive oil. It is traditionally served with a variety of blanched or cooked fresh vegetables such as sugar snap peas, haricots verts, cauliflower, zucchini, asparagus, and beets.
