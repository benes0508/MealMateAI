This recipe is for classic **French Fries**, made by double-frying peeled russet potatoes. The potatoes are first cut into 1/4-inch sticks and fried at 325°F for 1.5 minutes per batch, then re-fried at 350°F for about 5 minutes per batch until golden and crisp. The fries are seasoned with salt and can be served with mayonnaise.
