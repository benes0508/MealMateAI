**Fragrant Orange Chicken with Scallion Mashed Potatoes:** Chicken marinated in a flavorful blend of orange zest/juice, honey, soy sauce, garlic, and red pepper flakes, then baked until tender. The pan juices are reduced to create a rich sauce, drizzled over the chicken, and served with Scallion Mashed Potatoes.
