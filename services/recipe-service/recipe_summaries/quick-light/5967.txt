This recipe details how to make **homemade Chorizo**, a flavorful sausage. It involves blending rehydrated guajillo chiles with vinegar into a paste, which is then mixed with ground pork, pork fat, garlic, and a blend of spices. The mixture is then cured in the refrigerator for 1-3 days to allow flavors to meld. Optionally, the cured chorizo can be stuffed into hog casings to create links, which are then air-dried for several days before refrigeration or freezing. The recipe provides instructions for both bulk chorizo and linked sausage.
