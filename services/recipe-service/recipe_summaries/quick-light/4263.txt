This recipe details how to prepare a **Spatchcocked Turkey with Anise and Orange**. Aniseed is toasted and ground, then combined with salt, orange zest, brown sugar, rosemary, thyme, and pepper to create a flavorful rub. The turkey is spatchcocked (backbone removed and flattened), coated with this rub, and dry-brined in the refrigerator for 6-18 hours. It's then roasted on a bed of onions, carrots, celery, and garlic, basted with an anise-orange infused oil, until golden brown and cooked through. Finally, the turkey rests before carving.
