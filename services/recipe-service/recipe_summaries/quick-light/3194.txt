Radish Yogurt With Pine Nuts is a refreshing dish featuring thinly sliced and salted radishes, squeezed and chopped, then mixed with low-fat Greek yogurt, lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil. Toasted pine nuts are added as a topping, and it's served with cucumber spears for dipping. The yogurt mixture can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
