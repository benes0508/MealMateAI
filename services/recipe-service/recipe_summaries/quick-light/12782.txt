This recipe outlines a multi-stage process for **Glazed Duck with Clementine Sauce**. Ducks are first **braised** with aromatics until tender, then **chilled** to firm the meat and separate fat. They are subsequently **roasted at high heat** for crispy skin, brushed with a clementine glaze. A vibrant sauce is crafted from reduced clementine juice, vinegar, and sugar, combined with blanched zest and the defatted duck cooking liquid, then enriched by deglazing the pan and thickened with a liqueur and arrowroot. The result is tender, crisp-skinned duck served with a rich, tart-sweet citrus sauce.
