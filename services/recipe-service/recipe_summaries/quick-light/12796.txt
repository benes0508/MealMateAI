This is a quick and hearty vegetarian pasta dish featuring whole-wheat spaghetti, saut√©ed broccoli, and chickpeas. It's flavored with garlic and a hint of red pepper flakes. The pasta is cooked separately, then combined with the cooked vegetables in a skillet. Serve drizzled with olive oil, optionally with Parmesan and lemon.
