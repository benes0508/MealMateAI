This recipe is for a **3-Ingredient Tomato Soup** featuring roasted plum tomatoes for deep flavor. The process involves roasting halved tomatoes with oil, salt, and pepper until caramelized, while simultaneously saut√©ing onions. Both are then combined with heavy cream and water, simmered to meld flavors, and finally blended until smooth. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh pepper.
