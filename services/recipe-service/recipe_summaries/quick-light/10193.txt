"Chicken with Shallots, Prunes, and Armagnac" is a savory dish featuring browned chicken simmered in a rich sauce. The preparation involves boiling prunes with Armagnac, browning chicken pieces, then cooking shallots before deglazing with more Armagnac. Chicken broth, the Armagnac-infused prunes, and thyme are added, and the chicken is simmered until tender. Finally, the sauce is reduced with sherry wine vinegar and served over the chicken.
