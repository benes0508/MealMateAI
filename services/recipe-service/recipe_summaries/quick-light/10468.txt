This recipe details how to prepare **Scallops with Tarragon Cream and Wilted Butter Lettuce**. It involves searing sea scallops, creating a rich cream sauce flavored with shallots, white wine, and fresh tarragon (optionally with Pernod), and lightly wilting butter lettuce in the scallop drippings. The dish is then assembled by spooning the sauce onto plates, topping with wilted lettuce, and placing the seared scallops, garnished with fresh tarragon.
