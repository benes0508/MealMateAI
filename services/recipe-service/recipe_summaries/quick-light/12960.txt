This is a vibrant and aromatic basmati rice pilaf, studded with a colorful mix of dried apricots, golden raisins, and cranberries, subtly spiced with cardamom. A defining feature is the crispy, golden crust that forms at the bottom of the pot, served alongside fluffy rice and topped with toasted pistachios.
