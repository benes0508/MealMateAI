Hazelnut Mole is a unique, rich Mexican sauce featuring sautéed hazelnuts, plantains, apples, garlic, and onions, combined with guajillo and ancho chiles, prunes, and a blend of aromatic spices. The ingredients are sautéed, soaked in broth, then pureed until almost smooth, and simmered for nearly two hours until very thick. It can be made ahead.
