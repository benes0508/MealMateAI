This recipe details a **Fennel Gratin with Pecorino and Lemon**. It involves saut√©ing sliced fennel bulbs, onions, and garlic until tender, simmering them in chicken broth with herbs, then baking this mixture under a crispy topping of butter-toasted panko breadcrumbs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and fresh lemon peel. The dish can be prepared up to a day ahead before its final baking.
