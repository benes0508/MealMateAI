This recipe details how to prepare Pan-Roasted Rib Eyes. Thick, bone-in rib eyes are seasoned, then pan-seared to a golden brown before being transferred to an oven roasting pan with thyme, rosemary, and butter. They are then oven-roasted, frequently basted with the herb butter, and served with BÃ©arnaise sauce.
