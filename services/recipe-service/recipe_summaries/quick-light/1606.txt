This "Antipasto" Pasta recipe features spaghetti tossed with a savory sauce. The sauce is created by cooking dry-cured sausage with tomato paste, then incorporating marinated artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes. The dish is finished by combining the pasta and sauce with reserved pasta water, and garnished with toasted pine nuts and peperoncini for a slight kick.
