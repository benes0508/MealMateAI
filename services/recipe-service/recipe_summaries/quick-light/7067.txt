Peach-Vanilla Cream Pops are a refreshing frozen dessert made by puréeing fresh or thawed peaches with a homemade vanilla bean syrup. This strained peach-vanilla purée is then combined with heavy whipping cream and Greek yogurt, poured into ice pop molds, and frozen until firm. Amaretto is an optional addition.
