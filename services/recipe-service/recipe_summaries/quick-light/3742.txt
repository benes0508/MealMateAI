This recipe for Roasted Pork with Sage, Rosemary, and Garlic involves preparing a boneless pork loin by creating a channel and stuffing it with a mixture of chopped sage, rosemary, minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. The seasoned loin is then seared in an ovenproof skillet until browned. It's subsequently roasted at 375°F for 30 minutes with additional herb sprigs and crushed garlic, basting occasionally. After resting for 15 minutes, the pork is sliced, seasoned with sea salt, and served with pan juices. Tips for adjusting cooking time for larger loins and desired doneness (135°F for pink, 150°F for well-done) are provided.
