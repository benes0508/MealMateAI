A unique take on the classic Bloody Mary, this recipe creates a frozen granita using juicy red tomatoes, fresh basil, Worcestershire, and hot pepper sauce. The vodka is added tableside, poured over the scraped tomato granita flakes, and garnished with celery. It's a make-ahead friendly, savory, and refreshing beverage.
