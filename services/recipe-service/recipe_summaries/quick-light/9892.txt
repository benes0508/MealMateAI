This recipe details how to prepare a **Chilled Tomato-Tarragon Soup with Croutons**. The process involves first making crispy tarragon-infused olive oil croutons from baguette slices. Separately, a soup base is created by saut√©ing tomatoes, shallots, garlic, tarragon, and red pepper with tomato paste, then simmering until tender. The mixture is strained, seasoned, and then chilled before serving, garnished with the prepared croutons and fresh chopped tomatoes.
