This recipe details how to prepare **Grilled Shrimp with Molasses-Guava Glaze**. It involves making a sweet and tangy glaze from molasses, guava/apricot jam, butter, and lime peel. Shrimp are then skewered, seasoned with sea salt, brushed with the glaze, and grilled for a few minutes per side until opaque, finally drizzled with extra glaze before serving. The glaze and skewered shrimp can be prepped up to 8 hours ahead.
