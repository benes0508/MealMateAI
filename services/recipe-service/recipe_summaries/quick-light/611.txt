This "Salt-and-Squeeze Slaw" is a simple vegetable slaw that utilizes a unique method of salting and massaging thinly sliced cabbage, cucumbers, radishes, and onion to draw out excess moisture and achieve a tender, coleslaw-like texture. It's then dressed lightly with seasoned rice vinegar and olive oil. This make-ahead recipe can be prepared up to three days in advance.
