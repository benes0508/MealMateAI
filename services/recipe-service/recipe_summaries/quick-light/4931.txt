This recipe is for a "Polenta 'Pizza'" where cooked polenta is spread into a base, chilled (preferably overnight), and then topped with mozzarella, Parmesan, olive oil, and fresh sage. It's baked until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, then seasoned with red pepper flakes and black pepper, and served in wedges or squares.
