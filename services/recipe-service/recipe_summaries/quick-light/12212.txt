This recipe features roasted pork tenderloin served with a vibrant Kumquat-Jalapeño Marmalade. The marmalade is made by simmering finely chopped kumquats, shallots, Granny Smith apple, dried apricots, and jalapeño with sugar and water until thickened. The pork tenderloins are seasoned, browned in a skillet, then roasted in the oven until cooked through, and finally sliced to serve with the warm, sweet-spicy marmalade.
