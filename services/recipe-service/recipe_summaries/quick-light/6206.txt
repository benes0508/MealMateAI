This recipe guides you through making **Fresh Corn Tortillas** from masa flour, salt, and water. The dough is kneaded to a firm, springy consistency (like Play-Doh) and then portioned and flattened using a tortilla press lined with plastic. The tortillas are cooked in batches on a hot, lightly oiled cast-iron skillet until charred in spots and cooked through, then kept warm in a kitchen towel.
