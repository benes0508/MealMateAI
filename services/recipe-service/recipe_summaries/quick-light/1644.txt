This recipe details preparing a whole chicken roasted in a cast-iron skillet with fennel and carrots. Key steps include generously salting and resting the chicken (up to a day ahead), then roasting it alongside olive oil-coated vegetables in a preheated 425Â°F oven until cooked through. A crucial resting period of 20-45 minutes after roasting ensures a juicy result.
