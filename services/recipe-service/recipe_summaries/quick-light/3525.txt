This recipe details how to prepare a **Roast Goose with Oranges and Madeira**, featuring a rich pan sauce and sweet glazed shallots. The goose is first par-boiled and chilled for two days, then roasted with oranges and shallots in the cavity until tender and golden. A Madeira-based sauce is made from the goose neck, broth, and pan drippings, thickened with cornstarch and sweetened with honey. Separately, shallots are simmered in Madeira, broth, and honey to create a sweet glaze. The carved goose is served with the sauce and glazed shallots.
