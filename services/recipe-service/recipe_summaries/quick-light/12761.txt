This recipe describes how to make a savory grilled sandwich featuring a filling of saut√©ed mushrooms and marinated artichoke hearts, combined with thinly sliced Fontina cheese, all enclosed between slices of country-style bread brushed with olive oil. The sandwiches are then cooked in a skillet until golden brown and the cheese is melted.
