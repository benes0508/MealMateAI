**Soft Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Ricotta and Chives:** This recipe features gently cooked scrambled eggs, prepared in butter to be just set but still slightly runny. Fresh ricotta cheese is stirred in off the heat, preserving its creamy texture in visible clumps, and chives add a fresh herby note. Served atop toasted whole grain bread or baguette slices.
