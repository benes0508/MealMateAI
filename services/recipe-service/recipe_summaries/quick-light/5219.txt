This "Potato Chip Omelet" recipe describes a unique and hearty omelet featuring 12 eggs, heavy cream, fresh herbs (parsley, chives), and, notably, plain kettle-cooked potato chips folded into the egg mixture. The omelet is initially cooked on the stovetop in an ovenproof skillet and can be finished in the oven if needed, resulting in a set, golden omelet to be served in wedges.
