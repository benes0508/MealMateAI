This recipe for **Confit Duck Legs** involves marinating duck legs for 1-2 days with garlic, shallots, thyme, quatre épices, and bay leaves. The duck is then slow-cooked, submerged in rendered duck fat, at a low temperature (190-210°F) for 3-4 hours until fork-tender. After cooking, the legs are transferred to a bowl, covered with the strained duck fat, and chilled for at least 8 hours for preservation. To serve, the duck is removed from the fat and crisped skin-side down in a skillet.
