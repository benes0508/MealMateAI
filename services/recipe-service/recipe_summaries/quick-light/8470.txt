This recipe details how to prepare a Black Pepper Spice-Rubbed Beef Tenderloin. It involves toasting and grinding a blend of whole spices (black peppercorns, coriander, cumin, mustard, cloves, fennel, cardamom, cinnamon) with salt. The beef tenderloin is then rubbed with this mixture, seared in a skillet, and roasted in the oven until it reaches the desired internal temperature (e.g., 120Â°F for medium-rare), followed by a resting period before slicing and serving.
