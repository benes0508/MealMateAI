This recipe for Gnudi describes making soft, pillowy ricotta dumplings. Formed from a ricotta and Parmesan mixture, they are coated in semolina and **refrigerated for 3-4 days to firm up**. After a quick boil, they are finished in a butter-water sauce and served with nutty brown butter, crispy sage, and grated Parmesan.
