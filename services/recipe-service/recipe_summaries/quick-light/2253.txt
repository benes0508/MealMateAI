This recipe details a Cabbage Stir-Fry with Coconut and Lemon. It involves first toasting mustard seeds and chana/urad dal in oil until nutty, then adding dried chiles, finely chopped cabbage, salt, and turmeric to stir-fry until tender-crisp. Unsweetened coconut is then added and heated through, before the dish is finished off the heat with fresh cilantro and lemon juice for a bright, savory, and slightly nutty vegetable stir-fry.
