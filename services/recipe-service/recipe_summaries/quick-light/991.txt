Herby Garlic Confit is a slow-baked preparation where whole garlic cloves, fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, bay), and olive oil are gently roasted until the garlic becomes incredibly tender and jammy. It's a flavorful, versatile condiment or ingredient that can be made ahead and stored for up to two weeks.
