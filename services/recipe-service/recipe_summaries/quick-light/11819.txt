Coconut Milk Sticky Rice with Mangoes is a classic Thai dessert featuring steamed sticky rice infused with a sweet coconut milk sauce. Key ingredients include pre-soaked sticky rice, coconut milk, palm sugar (or brown sugar), salt, and ripe mangoes, garnished with mint or Asian basil. The preparation involves steaming the rice, heating coconut milk with sugar and salt (do not boil), then combining a portion of the hot sauce with the rice and letting it steep. Fresh mangoes are peeled and thinly sliced to accompany the rice. The dish is served with an oval mound of rice, sliced mangoes, and extra sweetened coconut milk on the side. It keeps well refrigerated for up to 24 hours and can be re-warmed.
