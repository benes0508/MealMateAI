This Summer Squash and Basil Pasta is a vibrant vegetarian dish. It features summer squash cooked until jammy with garlic, then tossed with al dente pasta. A light sauce is created by combining the pasta with Parmesan and pasta water, finished with fresh basil, lemon juice, and a hint of Aleppo pepper.
