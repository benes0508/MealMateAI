This recipe features a rich, savory dip made from deeply caramelized sweet onions and garam masala, blended with crème fraîche or sour cream, then chilled. It's served with homemade, oven-baked pita crisps flavored with aromatic cilantro-garlic oil. Both the dip and crisps can be prepared in advance.
