A versatile recipe for quick-pickled charred vegetables, featuring vegetables grilled until deeply browned but still firm, then marinated in a sweet-sour, spiced vinegar brine. The basic brine includes vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard, coriander, peppercorns, bay leaves, and garlic. Requires at least 3 hours of refrigeration for flavor development and keeps up to a week. Adaptable with variations like a Vietnamese-style chile-lime-star anise brine, a sweeter ginger version, or a spicy dilly pickle brine.
