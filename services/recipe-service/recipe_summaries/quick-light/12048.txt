This recipe is for an **Irish Cheddar and Stout Fondue**, a savory dish featuring grated Irish cheddar cheese melted into a base of Irish stout (such as Guinness), apple juice concentrate, and Dijon mustard. The cheese is tossed with flour to ensure a smooth, creamy texture. It is served warm with an assortment of steamed vegetables (red-skinned potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts) and fresh apple wedges for dipping.
