This recipe is for "The Only Salsa You Need," a roasted salsa made by broiling tomatoes, white onion, serrano chiles, and garlic until charred. Half of the broiled tomatoes are blended with the garlic until smooth, then the remaining tomatoes are pulsed for texture. The chopped broiled onion and chiles, along with fresh lime juice and cilantro, are stirred in, seasoned with salt, and served with tortilla chips.
