This recipe is for a Zucchini-Basil Soup. It involves sautéing onion and garlic, then simmering chopped zucchini with water before puréeing it with fresh basil to create a smooth soup base. A portion of the zucchini is julienned, salted, and then blanched to be used as a garnish on top of the served soup.
