This recipe details how to prepare **Mini Herbed Pommes Anna**, an elegant side dish made from thinly sliced waxy potatoes (like Yukon Gold). The potato slices are tossed in butter infused with fresh thyme and garlic, then artfully layered in individual muffin cups. They are baked in a two-stage process: first covered until tender, then inverted and baked at a higher temperature until golden and crispy.
