This recipe creates homemade ravioli from wonton wrappers, filled with goat cheese, Parmesan, mascarpone, and herbs. These are served over a savory base of charred red, yellow, and green bell peppers sautéed with onion and tomato. The dish is finished with a nutty brown butter sauce, toasted pine nuts, Niçoise olives, and fresh chives.
