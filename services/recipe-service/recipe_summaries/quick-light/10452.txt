This recipe details how to prepare a **Classic Roast Turkey with Herbed Stuffing and Old-Fashioned Gravy**. It involves roasting a 12-pound turkey (prepared by removing giblets, rinsing, and loosely stuffing with herbed stuffing) in a 325°F oven for approximately 4 hours, basting periodically, until the thigh reaches 180°F and stuffing 165°F. After resting the turkey, a rich gravy is made from the pan drippings, turkey stock, and reserved fat, thickened with flour. Simultaneously, extra stuffing is baked until heated through. The recipe emphasizes food safety, particularly for stuffing, and provides tips for turkey selection and post-roasting resting.
