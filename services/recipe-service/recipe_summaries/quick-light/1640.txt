This recipe for "Sour Candied Citrus Peels" involves blanching citrus peels (oranges, grapefruit, lemons, or limes) multiple times to reduce bitterness, then simmering them in a sugar syrup until translucent. Once cooled, the peels are tossed in a mixture of sugar and citric acid for a sour coating, then dried at room temperature. They can be stored airtight for up to a month.
