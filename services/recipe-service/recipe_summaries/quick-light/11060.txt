This recipe details how to prepare **Pan-Seared Scallops with Lemon Sauce**. Large scallops are first pan-seared until browned, then finished in a 400Â°F oven. The accompanying sauce is made by reducing white wine with shallots, garlic, and lemon peel, then enriching it with heavy cream and turmeric, and finishing with fresh lemon juice. The sauce can be prepared a day ahead. Serve the scallops arranged atop the lemon sauce.
