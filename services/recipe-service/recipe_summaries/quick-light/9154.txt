This recipe details how to create a sourdough starter (levain) over several days.

**Initial Setup:** Combine organic rye or whole wheat flour with bottled water, forming a stiff dough. Store in a covered glass jar in a cool area (65°F) for 48 hours.

**Feeding & Activation:**
*   **Day 3 onwards:** Discard half the starter daily. Feed it with bread flour and bottled water.
*   **Observations:** Expect the consistency to become like thick pancake batter with bubbles. It should expand significantly (double or triple) in volume within 24 hours, dome, and then recede, possibly emitting a faint citrus aroma.
*   **Readiness:** Continue daily feeding until the starter consistently shows this high activity.

**Usage & Maintenance:** Once active, the starter can be used for baking (expand it with flour and water) or refrigerated. It will mature over 2-3 weeks with consistent feeding (3 times/week), gaining strength and flavor. After maturity, it can be fed once a week if not baking more frequently. Maintain about ¾ cup of starter for regular use.
