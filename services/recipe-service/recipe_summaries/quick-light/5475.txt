This recipe details how to prepare a Roast Pork Loin With Rosemary and Garlic. A boneless pork loin is butterflied, filled with a paste of finely chopped garlic, fresh rosemary, olive oil, and salt, then rolled and tied. It's roasted at 400°F with dry white wine until an internal temperature of 145°F is reached (approx. 1.5-2 hours). After resting, the pork is sliced and served with the pan juices. The loin can be stuffed and tied a day ahead.
