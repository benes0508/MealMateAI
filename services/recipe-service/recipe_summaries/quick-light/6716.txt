This recipe details how to make Tacos with Pork in Green Sauce (Tacos de cerdo en salsa verde). Pork shoulder is browned, then slow-simmered in a homemade green sauce. The sauce is prepared by blending cooked tomatillos and chiles (serrano or jalape√±o) with toasted spices (cumin, allspice, clove), garlic, and cilantro. The pork simmers in this sauce for 1.5-2 hours until tender, then shredded and served in tacos.
