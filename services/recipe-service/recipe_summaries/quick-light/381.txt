Mala Fried Peanuts is a crispy, spicy, and numbing Sichuan-style snack or appetizer. Raw peanuts are prepped by soaking (if unblanched) and then *frozen to ensure maximum crispness when fried*. They are deep-fried, then combined with pan-fried Sichuan chiles, Sichuan peppercorns, five-spice powder, and other seasonings. Can be made up to 3 days ahead.
