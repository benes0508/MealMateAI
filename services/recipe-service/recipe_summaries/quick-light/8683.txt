This recipe details how to prepare **Linguine with Summer Succotash**. It involves cooking linguine, then creating a unique creamy sauce by blending a portion of the fresh corn kernels with reserved pasta water. The remaining corn and sugar snap peas are sautéed until crisp-tender. Finally, the cooked pasta, sautéed vegetables, corn puree, halved tomatoes, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese are tossed together until well combined and coated, seasoned, and served with additional Parmesan.
