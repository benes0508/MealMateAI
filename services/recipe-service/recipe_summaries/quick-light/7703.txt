"Eggs with Tomato on Toast" is a quick dish featuring a savory tomato sauce base enriched with egg whites. Garlic, peperoncini, and oregano are saut√©ed, then crushed tomatoes are added and cooked until concentrated. Egg whites are stirred in to thicken the sauce, after which egg yolks are gently placed into indentations and warmed through. The dish is served immediately on toasted bread.
