A homemade chutney featuring cranberries, dried figs, and Pinot Noir, along with ginger and orange zest. Figs are rehydrated in Pinot Noir before being combined with cranberries, sugar, ginger, and orange zest. The mixture is simmered until the cranberries burst and the chutney thickens. Ideal for preparing in advance and serving chilled or at room temperature.
