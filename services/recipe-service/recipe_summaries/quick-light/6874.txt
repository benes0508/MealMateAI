This recipe details how to make **Pots de Crème with Riesling-Poached Grapes**. The dish consists of a rich, baked custard (Pots de Crème) served alongside grapes simmered in off-dry Riesling.

The grapes are first reduced with Riesling and sugar, then chilled. The custard is prepared by whisking egg yolks with sugar, then gradually incorporating simmering cream, milk, and sour cream. This mixture is sieved, divided into ramekins, and baked in a water bath until just set, then thoroughly chilled before serving with the poached grapes spooned over.
