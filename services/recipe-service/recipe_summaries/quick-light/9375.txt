This recipe details how to prepare Sherry Vinegar and Molasses Glazed Carrots. Small carrots are first sautÃ©ed in butter, then braised in sherry vinegar and water until tender and the liquid reduces to a syrupy glaze. Additional molasses and vinegar are added at the end to create a thick, sweet-tangy coating. The dish is finished with fresh Italian parsley and can be made up to 4 hours ahead.
