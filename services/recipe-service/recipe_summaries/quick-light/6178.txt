Tyroshi Honeyfingers are a sweet fried dough pastry. They are made by cooking flour and milk into a porridge, then mixing in egg, pine nuts, and spices to form a sticky dough. This dough is cut into finger-sized strips, fried until golden and crispy, then dipped in honey and garnished with cinnamon and pine nuts.
