This recipe details how to make sweet and savory Five-Spice Pecans. Pecan halves are coated on the stovetop with a warm mixture of dark brown sugar, water, vegetable oil, five-spice powder, ground cumin, and black pepper. They are then spread on a baking sheet, sprinkled with kosher salt, and baked at 350Â°F for 8-10 minutes until fragrant and crisp.
