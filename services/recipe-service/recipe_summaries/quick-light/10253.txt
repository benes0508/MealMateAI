This recipe for Roasted Garbanzo Beans and Garlic with Swiss Chard features two main components. First, garbanzo beans, whole garlic cloves, shallots, and bay leaves are roasted with olive oil until tender. Separately, Swiss chard is sautÃ©ed with crushed garlic, sliced shallots, and bay leaves, then braised in low-salt chicken broth until tender and drained. Finally, the roasted garbanzo mixture is combined with the cooked chard and warmed through, seasoned to taste. Both components can be prepared ahead of time.
