This recipe details how to create Toasted-Coconut Caramel Ice Cream Sundaes. It involves making a homemade coconut-infused caramel sauce by cooking sugar to a dark amber, then whisking in heavy cream and sweetened cream of coconut. Sweetened flaked coconut is oven-toasted until golden. Both the caramel sauce and toasted coconut can be prepared in advance. To serve, scoop French vanilla ice cream into bowls, then top with warm caramel sauce and toasted coconut.
