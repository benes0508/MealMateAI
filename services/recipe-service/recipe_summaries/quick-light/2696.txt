This recipe describes how to make a **Hibiscus-Mint Granita**, a refreshing frozen dessert. It involves steeping dried hibiscus flowers in hot water, sweetening the infusion with sugar, and adding lime juice and fresh mint. The mixture is then frozen in a shallow dish, periodically mashed to create a flaky, icy texture, and served chilled with a mint garnish.
