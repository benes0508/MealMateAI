This recipe is for a vegetable "meatloaf" made primarily from lentils, brown rice, and a medley of vegetables like onion, carrot, celery, spinach, and corn. It's bound with eggs and cheese, then baked with a topping of sliced tomatoes and mozzarella. A fresh "checca" sauce made from cherry tomatoes, scallions, garlic, and basil is prepared separately and served alongside.
