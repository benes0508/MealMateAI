This recipe details how to make a Cranberry Sauce featuring both fresh and dried cranberries, flavored with ruby port and cinnamon. It involves simmering port and cinnamon, then adding dried and fresh cranberries, water, and sugar. The mixture is then simmered until the sauce thickens, darkens, and the berries collapse. The sauce should be cooled, cinnamon sticks discarded, and can be made up to 3 days ahead, served at room temperature.
