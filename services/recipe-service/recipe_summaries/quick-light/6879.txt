This recipe for Skillet-Roasted Chicken with Farro and Herb Pistou features chicken halves first marinated overnight in a fresh herb, garlic, and lemon mixture. They are then gently poached before being seared in a hot cast-iron skillet and finished in the oven for crispy skin. The chicken is served over a prepared farro dish (Farro with Acorn Squash and Kale), drizzled with a vibrant herb pistou, fresh lemon, and garnished with chives.
