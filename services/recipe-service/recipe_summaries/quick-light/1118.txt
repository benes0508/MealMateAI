This is a plant-based fried rice recipe featuring brown rice (or other grains), tofu, kale (or broccoli rabe), and carrots, seasoned with turmeric, soy sauce, and green onions. It involves cooking the rice separately, then stir-frying the vegetables and tofu before combining with the rice and a turmeric-soy sauce mixture.
