This recipe details how to make **Roasted Red Onion Flowers**. Whole red or sweet onions are vertically cut into 8 wedges, leaving the root intact, then drizzled with olive oil, seasoned with salt (smoked recommended) and herbs (rosemary, thyme, bay leaves). They are roasted at 350Â°F for 40 minutes, then fanned open, basted with pan juices, and roasted for another 20 minutes until tender with crispy edges. Serve hot or at room temperature as a side dish, or as a light dinner with cheese and a green salad.
