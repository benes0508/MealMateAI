This Pickled Shrimp recipe features shrimp briefly cooked and then marinated in a zesty blend of cider vinegar, olive oil, garlic, and aromatic spices like mustard, coriander, and red pepper flakes. The shrimp, along with thin slices of onion and lemon, are chilled and marinated for 12-24 hours, finished with fresh dill or parsley.
