This recipe features grilled hot dogs served in buns with a unique relish made from mango chutney, chopped red onion, fresh cilantro, and Dijon mustard. Both the hot dogs and buns are grilled until heated through and marked, then assembled with the relish and an optional extra dollop of mustard. The relish can be prepared a day in advance.
