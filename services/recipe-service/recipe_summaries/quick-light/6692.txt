This recipe details **Yukon Gold Potato and Jerusalem Artichoke Latkes** served with two distinct toppings: a homemade **Apple-Horseradish Mayonnaise** and store-bought **Taramasalata**. The latkes are made by grating and wringing out a mixture of potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and onion, then combining with egg, parsley, and flour before frying until golden. The apple-horseradish mayonnaise is a simple blend of grated horseradish, applesauce, vinegar, mustard, and mayonnaise. Latkes are served immediately, split between the two toppings and garnished with chives.
