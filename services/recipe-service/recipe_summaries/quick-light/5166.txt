This recipe for "Stir-Fried Buckwheat" creates a savory grain-and-vegetable dish. Buckwheat groats are first coated in egg and lightly toasted, then simmered in vegetable broth until tender. While the buckwheat cools, a sauce is prepared from soy sauce, rice vinegar, chile paste, and sugar. The dish is finished by stir-frying scallions, garlic, ginger, carrots, bell pepper, and green beans in a wok, then adding the cooked buckwheat and the prepared sauce, tossing until heated through.
