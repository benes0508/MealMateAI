This recipe details how to make homemade Mascarpone using heavy cream (without thickeners), powdered skim milk, and lemon. The process involves slowly heating the cream and milk to 180Â°F, then adding lemon juice in stages to gently coagulate the mixture (stirring with a spoon, not a whisk). The cream is then chilled for 8 hours or overnight to firm, and finally drained through butter muslin to achieve its thick consistency. The homemade Mascarpone has a very short shelf life and should be refrigerated and used within 2 days.
