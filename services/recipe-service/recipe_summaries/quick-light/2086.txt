This is a classic French Gribiche dressing, featuring finely chopped hard-boiled eggs, cornichons, capers, whole grain mustard, olive oil, white wine vinegar, and fresh herbs like tarragon and parsley. It's a whisked emulsion with the eggs and herbs gently folded in, and can be made up to 2 days ahead.
