This recipe for Roasted Broccolini with Winey Mushrooms features broccolini roasted until crisp-tender. Separately, a savory topping is made by saut√©ing diced sweet onion and thinly sliced cremini mushrooms until golden brown, then deglazing the pan with dry white wine. The winey mushroom mixture is spooned over the roasted broccolini and can be optionally served with grated Parmesan cheese.
