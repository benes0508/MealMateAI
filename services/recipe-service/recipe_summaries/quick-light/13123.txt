This recipe is for a **Kale and Potato Spanish Tortilla**, a savory dish made with diced boiled potatoes, saut√©ed onions, wilted and chopped kale, and eggs. The vegetables are cooked in olive oil, then mixed with beaten eggs and cooked slowly in a skillet until set, finally inverted to cook the other side, resulting in a thick, hearty tortilla.
