This recipe creates a **Grilled Vegetable Antipasto** featuring zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, red bell peppers, and scallions grilled until tender. These are arranged with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh tomato slices, then served alongside slices of **herbed chevre** (a chevre log rolled in parsley and pepper) and drizzled with a homemade **herbed balsamic vinaigrette**. The dish is typically served with **homemade crostini** (baked baguette slices brushed with an herb-butter mixture).
