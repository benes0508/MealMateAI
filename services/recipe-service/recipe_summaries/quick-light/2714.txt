English Chili Sauce is a very hot and tangy condiment made primarily from hot peppers, cider vinegar, sugar, and pickling salt. The peppers are cooked, then pur√©ed with their seeds to ensure maximum heat, before being simmered with sugar and salt until thick. Designed as a concentrated seasoning, it is typically preserved in jars.
