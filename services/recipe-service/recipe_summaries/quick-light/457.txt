This recipe details how to make Lavash, a thin, pliable bread. It begins by preparing an "old dough" (preferment) with flour, water, and yeast, which ferments for several hours or overnight. This is then combined with more flour, water, oil, and salt, mixed, and kneaded until smooth, followed by multiple resting and proofing periods. The dough is portioned, shaped into balls, and rolled very thin. Finally, the lavash is quickly cooked on a hot surface—an upside-down wok, a cast-iron griddle, or a grill—until it puffs and blisters. It's best eaten fresh but can be stored and rehydrated with water if it becomes brittle.
