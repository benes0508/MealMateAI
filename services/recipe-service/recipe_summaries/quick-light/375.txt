Scallion-Oil Noodles is a simple yet flavorful noodle dish primarily featuring lo mein noodles. The recipe involves slowly infusing oil with scallions until they are crispy and golden, creating a fragrant scallion oil. Cooked noodles are then tossed with this homemade scallion oil, soy paste, and soy sauce, and garnished with the reserved crispy scallions. Both the scallion oil and crispy scallions can be prepared a day ahead.
