This recipe details how to make truffled French fries using a double-frying method for crispiness. Russet potatoes are first fried in peanut oil at 300°F until tender, then re-fried at 360-365°F until golden brown. The finished fries are seasoned with salt and tossed with truffle oil before serving.
