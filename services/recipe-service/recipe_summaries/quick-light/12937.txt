This recipe details the preparation of Banana-Black Bean Empanadas. It involves sautéing bananas and then combining them with a savory filling made from sautéed onions, black beans, cilantro, cumin, and cayenne pepper. This mixture is mashed and cooled. Puff pastry squares are filled with the bean mixture, Monterey Jack cheese, and the sautéed bananas, folded into triangles, sealed, brushed with an egg glaze, and baked until golden.
