This recipe is for Giada de Laurentiis's **Spicy Tomato Sauce**. It's a savory and piquant sauce made with crushed Italian tomatoes, olive oil, sautéed onion and garlic, black olives, capers, and a generous amount of dried crushed red pepper flakes. The preparation involves quickly sautéing the aromatics and other flavorings before simmering everything for about 20 minutes until slightly reduced. It can be made a day ahead.
