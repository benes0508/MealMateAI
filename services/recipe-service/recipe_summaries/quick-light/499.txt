This recipe features **Roasted Garlic and Parmesan Baked Halibut**. Halibut fillets are seasoned and baked until opaque. Separately, a head of garlic is roasted until soft. A topping is then made by blending six cloves of the roasted garlic with mayonnaise and grated parmesan. This mixture is spread over the baked fish, which is then broiled briefly until golden brown for a rich, savory finish.
