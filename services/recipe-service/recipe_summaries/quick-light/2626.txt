This recipe details how to make a rich and creamy Roasted Garlic and Brie Soup. It involves roasting garlic until tender, sautéing a mirepoix (onion, celery, carrot) with a roux, simmering with chicken stock, then puréeing the roasted garlic and blending it back into the soup. Finally, Brie cheese is gradually stirred in until melted, creating a smooth and flavorful soup, seasoned with herbs and white pepper. It can be prepared a day ahead before adding the Brie.
