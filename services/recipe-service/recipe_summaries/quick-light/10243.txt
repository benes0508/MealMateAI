This recipe for Garlic Confit involves gently simmering peeled garlic cloves in olive oil until very soft and tender (approximately one hour), ensuring they do not brown. The resulting mellow, spreadable garlic and fragrant, infused oil make a versatile make-ahead condiment that can be stored chilled for up to a month.
