**Brothy Beans**

A simple, comforting, and slow-simmered dish featuring various dried beans (gigante, cannellini, baby lima, or chickpeas) cooked until tender in a flavorful broth with aromatics (onion, carrots, celery, discarded before serving). Generously seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil, this versatile recipe is ideal as a light meal or side, perfect for plant-based and comfort food categories. Requires overnight bean soaking and a long cooking time (~2.5 hours).
