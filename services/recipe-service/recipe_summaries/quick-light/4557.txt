This recipe details a **quick and simple kimchi relish**. Half of the kimchi is caramelized with sugar and cider vinegar until sticky and browned, then combined with the remaining fresh, uncooked kimchi. This creates a sweet, tangy, and savory condiment with a textural contrast, suitable as a side or topping.
