This recipe prepares **Sesame-Pepper Bean Sprouts**, a simple side dish. Mung bean sprouts are briefly boiled until tender-crisp, then tossed with toasted sesame oil, a seasoning blend of toasted sesame seeds, salt, and black pepper, and finished with gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder) for a hint of spice.
