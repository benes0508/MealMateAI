Green Shakshuka is a vibrant variation of the classic, featuring eggs baked in a flavorful sauce primarily made from puréed green Swiss chard. This unique sauce is blended with serrano chiles, cilantro, toasted caraway seeds, and cumin, providing a herbaceous and subtly spicy base. The dish starts by sautéing onions and remaining Swiss chard pieces, then adding the green purée, creating wells, and cracking in eggs before baking until just set. It's finished with a sprinkle of harissa powder and fresh dill.
