This recipe details how to make "Chicken Under a Brick," a grilled chicken dish. A spatchcocked chicken is rubbed with oil, salt, and pepper, then grilled under foil-wrapped bricks over indirect high heat. The bricks flatten the chicken, ensuring crisp skin and even cooking until it's golden and reaches an internal temperature of 165Â°F.
