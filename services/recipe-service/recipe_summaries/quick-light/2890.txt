This recipe creates **Sardine Toasts with Tomato Mayonnaise and Fennel**. It involves roasting plum tomatoes to make a flavorful pur√©e, which is then blended with mayonnaise and a custom spice mix (fenugreek, cumin, black peppercorns). Country-style bread is grilled until lightly charred. The toasts are topped with the unique tomato mayonnaise, oil-packed sardines, and a fresh fennel salad made with dill, parsley, and lemon juice. The tomato mayonnaise can be prepared ahead of time.
