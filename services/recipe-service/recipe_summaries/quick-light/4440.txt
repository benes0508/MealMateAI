This recipe details how to make Zucchini Patties. Grated zucchini and onion are salted and squeezed to remove excess liquid, then mixed with leek, egg, panko, cilantro, and thyme. Spoonfuls of the mixture are pan-fried in vegetable oil until golden brown (about 3 minutes per side), then drained and seasoned. They are served with Roasted Red Pepper Labneh and can be kept warm in the oven.
