**Coconut Chocolate Bites** is a no-bake dessert. A sweet coconut base, made from flaked coconut and condensed milk, is pressed into a pan, topped with a layer of melted bittersweet chocolate, and chilled. The chilled confection is then halved, stacked, and cut into 32 one-inch squares, requiring further chilling before serving.
