This recipe details how to prepare homemade Anchovy Mayonnaise. It involves whisking an egg yolk, mustard, and lemon juice, then gradually emulsifying with grapeseed and olive oils. Finely chopped anchovy fillets are then incorporated for a savory, umami-rich condiment. The mayonnaise should be chilled and can be made up to a day ahead.
