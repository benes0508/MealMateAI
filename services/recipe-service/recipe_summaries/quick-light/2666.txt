This recipe features mussels steamed in a flavorful and spicy tomato oil. The oil is first used to crisp garlic (reserved for topping), then to cook down tomatoes with chili oil and lightly crushed fennel seeds, creating a rich sauce. After steaming the mussels in this base, butter is stirred into the tomato oil, which is then ladled over the mussels. It's garnished with fresh chives and crispy garlic, and served with grilled country bread.
