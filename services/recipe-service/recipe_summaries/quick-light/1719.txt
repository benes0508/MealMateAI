This Tomato-Lemon Tart recipe features a frozen puff pastry base brushed with garlic oil, layered with thin lemon slices, fresh basil, and sliced ripe tomatoes. The tart is baked at 375°F for 30-35 minutes until the pastry is golden and crisp, then cooled slightly before serving, optionally topped with crème fraîche.
