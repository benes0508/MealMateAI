This recipe for Fresh Herb Platter, also known as Sabzi Khordan, is a traditional Middle Eastern (Persian) no-cook dish. It features an assortment of fresh herbs (spearmint, basil, cilantro, parsley, etc.) served alongside crumbled feta cheese infused with toasted and steeped spices (coriander, cumin, caraway). Accompanied by walnuts, radishes, and scallions, it's typically enjoyed by wrapping small portions of herbs, spiced feta, and other elements in lavash or other flatbread.
