This recipe details a unique pasta dish featuring a savory cream sauce centered around an unexpected ingredient: cantaloupe. Crisped pancetta and saut√©ed shallots form the base, to which diced cantaloupe is added and cooked until it completely breaks down into a smooth, thick sauce. Heavy cream, marjoram, salt, and pepper are then added and reduced. The sauce is finally combined with al dente pasta and Parmigiano Reggiano, served immediately.
