Pomegranate Gelato is a creamy dessert made by boiling a base of heavy cream, milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Pomegranate juice, liqueur, and fresh lemon juice are then whisked in. The mixture is chilled, frozen in an ice cream maker, and hardened before serving, optionally garnished with pomegranate seeds.
