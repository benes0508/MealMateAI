This recipe details how to make "Watermelon Jell-O Shots" using lime halves as the rind. It involves preparing lime shells, dissolving strawberry and plain gelatin with hot water (and optional sugar), filling the lime shells with the mixture, partially setting them, then adding passion fruit seeds to mimic watermelon seeds, chilling until firm, and finally cutting them in half lengthwise for serving.
