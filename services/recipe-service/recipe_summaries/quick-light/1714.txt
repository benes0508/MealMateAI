This recipe for Detroit-Style Pizza yields a thick, airy, and crispy rectangular crust with characteristic caramelized cheese edges. It involves preparing a yeast dough that is double-risen and pressed into a pan, along with a flavorful tomato sauce cooked with herbs and garlic. The pizza is topped with Parmesan, mozzarella, and brick cheeses (plus optional pepperoni) and baked at a high temperature until golden, with the warm sauce traditionally ladled over the top *after* baking.
