A comforting turkey congee (rice porridge) made by simmering a turkey carcass with aromatics like ginger, cinnamon, and star anise to create a flavorful stock. Long-grain rice is then cooked in this rich stock until it breaks down into a thick, oatmeal-like consistency. It's served topped with savory crispy shiitake mushrooms and often garnished with fresh cilantro and chili oil.
