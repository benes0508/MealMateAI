This recipe details how to make authentic Carbonara, featuring guanciale, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese (or a mix with Parmigiano Reggiano), and black pepper. Key steps include lightly saut√©ing guanciale, whisking eggs and cheese, and then combining the cooked pasta with the guanciale and egg mixture *off direct heat*. The goal is a creamy sauce achieved by the pasta's residual heat, ensuring the eggs cook without scrambling. Serve immediately.
