A classic Roman pasta dish, Pasta alla Gricia features rigatoni with crispy rendered guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl) and Pecorino Romano cheese. The dish is characterized by finishing partially cooked pasta directly in the skillet with the rendered guanciale fat and reserved pasta water, creating a rich, glossy emulsified sauce. It's then tossed with the crispy guanciale, black pepper, and Pecorino, served with an extra grating of cheese.
