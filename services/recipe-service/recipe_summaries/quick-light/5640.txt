Mojo Rojo is a vibrant Spanish sauce featuring a smoky, garlicky, and mildly spicy flavor. It's prepared by blending garlic, dried guindilla or New Mexico chiles, smoked paprika, ground cumin, and salt into a paste, then emulsifying with extra virgin olive oil and finishing with sherry vinegar and water.
