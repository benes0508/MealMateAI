This recipe for "Root Vegetables Anna" features thinly sliced russet potatoes, celery root, and turnip, layered with butter, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a skillet. It's cooked first on the stovetop to create a golden, crispy bottom layer, then transferred to the oven to finish baking until all vegetables are tender. The resulting dish is then inverted onto a platter and served in wedges.
