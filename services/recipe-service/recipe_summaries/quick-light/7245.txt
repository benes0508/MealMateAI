This recipe details how to prepare Brisket. A 4-pound brisket is seasoned with a spice rub (onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, celery salt) and refrigerated for 1-2 days. It's then browned in corn oil, transferred to a Dutch oven with water, and simmered for 1 hour. Separately, saut√©ed onions and fresh garlic are added, and the brisket continues to simmer for another 2.5 hours until tender. Finally, the fat is trimmed, and the brisket is sliced against the grain to be served hot with its gravy or cold in sandwiches.
