This recipe details how to prepare a **Roast Chicken with Rosemary-Orange Butter**. A whole chicken is seasoned with a compound butter made from shallots, butter, fresh rosemary, and orange peel, applied both under and over the skin. It's roasted at 400Â°F for about 1 hour 40 minutes alongside aromatics (onion, carrots, celery, shallots, chicken neck/heart) in a roasting pan. After roasting, a pan sauce is made from the drippings by deglazing with dry white wine and reducing with chicken broth. The chicken is served with the strained pan sauce.
