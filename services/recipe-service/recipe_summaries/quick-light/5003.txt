Oregano Eggs (Uova all'Origano) is a simple dish of 8 eggs gently cooked in an olive oil-swirled skillet, seasoned with salt, dried oregano, and grated Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese. Cooked covered over medium-low heat until the whites are set and yolks are done to preference (about 7-8 minutes for runny), it's versatile as breakfast, a main course, or an appetizer.
