"Stir-Fried Egg and Tomato" is a quick, savory dish featuring lightly scrambled eggs and stir-fried tomatoes with scallions. The eggs are cooked until barely set, then removed, while tomatoes are stir-fried until softened and seasoned with salt and a touch of sugar. The eggs are then returned to the pan to finish cooking, and the dish is served garnished with scallions, typically with white rice.
