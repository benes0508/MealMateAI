This recipe prepares **Scallops with Asparagus** by first saut√©ing **asparagus** until tender. **Large sea scallops** are then seared in batches until browned and cooked through. The skillet is deglazed with **dry white wine and white wine vinegar** to create a reduction, which is then finished with **butter** to form a rich sauce. The asparagus is added back to warm, and the dish is served with the seared scallops topped with the asparagus and sauce.
