This recipe is for **Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails**, a rich and savory dish. Oxtails are seared and then slow-braised in the oven for 3-3.5 hours with a reduced red wine sauce, beef broth, and aromatic vegetables like shallots, garlic, carrots, leeks, onion, and celery, along with herbs. The braising liquid is strained, reduced, and finished with butter to create a glossy sauce. It's typically served with celery root puree or mashed potatoes.
