Sambal Shrimp Lettuce Wraps feature pan-seared shrimp quickly marinated in a sweet, spicy, and tangy sauce made from sambal oelek, honey, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. These are served deconstructed, allowing guests to build their own wraps with fresh Bibb lettuce, thinly sliced cucumbers, mint sprigs, and a sprinkle of crushed peanuts. A portion of the marinade is reserved as a dipping sauce.
