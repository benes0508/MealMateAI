This recipe is for Red-Lentil Soup, a comforting and flavorful dish. It features red lentils cooked with a base of sautéed onion and garlic, seasoned with cumin, bay leaf, and fresh thyme, then simmered in chicken broth and water until the lentils are very soft. A portion of the soup is puréed for a thicker consistency, and it's finished with fresh parsley and served with lemon wedges.
