**Black-Bean Burgers:** These pan-fried vegetarian burgers are made primarily from black beans, seasoned with cumin, oregano, cayenne, and cilantro, and bound with mayonnaise and bread crumbs. One can of beans is pulsed to a pur√©e while the other is kept whole for texture. The mixture is formed into four patties and cooked for about 5 minutes until crisp and browned. Serve on hamburger buns with suggested accompaniments like sour cream, salsa, and lettuce.
