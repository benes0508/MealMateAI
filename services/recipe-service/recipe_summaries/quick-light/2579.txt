Slow-Cooked Garlicky Greens is a dish featuring hardy greens (like kale, chard, or collards) blanched and then slow-cooked in olive oil infused with crushed garlic and chiles. The greens are simmered until tender, then finished with fresh lemon juice, salt, pepper, and an additional drizzle of olive oil.
