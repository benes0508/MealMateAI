This recipe details how to prepare tender baby back ribs with a sticky, savory-sweet, and tangy glaze. The ribs are first simmered in a soy sauce, garlic, cumin, and red pepper broth until very tender, then drained. A separate glaze is made from soy sauce, orange juice, honey, toasted cumin, red pepper flakes, garlic, and scallions, cooked until thick. Finally, the ribs are brushed with the glaze and broiled until caramelized and bubbling, finished with fresh scallions and citrus zest.
