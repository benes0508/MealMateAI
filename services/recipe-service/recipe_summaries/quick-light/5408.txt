This recipe details how to prepare classic Fried Chicken with Gravy. It involves brining chicken overnight, dredging it in seasoned flour, and pan-frying slowly until golden brown and cooked through. The gravy is then made in the same skillet using the drippings, flour, water, and seasonings, cooked until thick and smooth. The dish is served with the gravy, often alongside biscuits.
