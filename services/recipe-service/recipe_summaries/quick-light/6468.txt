Mustard Caviar is a homemade condiment made by simmering brown and yellow mustard seeds in a sweetened and salted vinegar solution until they achieve a "popping" texture. It offers a unique sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy flavor, ideal as a garnish or accompaniment, and can be refrigerated for up to two weeks.
