**Garlic Confit** is a simple preparation involving slow-baking peeled garlic cloves in grapeseed oil. The garlic and oil are baked at 250Â°F for about 2 hours until golden and tender. Once cooled, the confit can be stored in an airtight container with the oil for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator, making it an excellent make-ahead ingredient or condiment.
