This recipe for "Nextover" Chicken Tacos quickly repurposes leftover shredded chicken, warming it with tomatillo salsa. Served in charred corn tortillas, it's accompanied by quick, homemade refried black beans (mashed with garlic) and topped with avocado, cilantro, and optional slaw, with lime wedges and hot sauce.
