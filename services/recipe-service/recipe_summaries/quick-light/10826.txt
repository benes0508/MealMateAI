This recipe is for **Pork Tenderloin with Apricot Mustard**. Pork tenderloins are coated in a mustard-garlic-apricot jam mixture, seasoned with salt and pepper, and then broiled alongside quartered fresh apricots until the pork reaches 145Â°F and apricots are softened (about 15 minutes). After resting, the pork is sliced and served with the apricots spooned over it, and extra mustard-jam sauce on the side.
