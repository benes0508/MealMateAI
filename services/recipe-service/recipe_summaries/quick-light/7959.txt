"Pasta with Pesto My Way" is a vegetarian-friendly dish featuring pasta (rotini or penne) tossed with a pesto sauce. It incorporates a variety of vegetables cooked directly with the pasta—zucchini, potatoes, green beans, and corn—while cherry tomatoes are separately sautéed until wilted. The pesto is thinned with reserved pasta water, then combined with the pasta and vegetables. The dish is served immediately, garnished with the sautéed tomatoes and toasted bread crumbs.
