This recipe is for **Poori**, a traditional Indian deep-fried puffy bread. It involves combining **chapati or whole wheat flour with all-purpose flour, salt, and oil** to form a soft, pliable dough. The dough is kneaded, rested, then divided into small balls and rolled into thin, 5-inch circles. These are deep-fried in hot oil (400Â°F), using a specific technique of gentle pressing with a slotted spoon to make them puff up. Poori is typically served immediately or can be reheated, and pairs well with a variety of Indian vegetarian and meat dishes, such as Tari Aloo or Keema Matar.
