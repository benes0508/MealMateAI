This recipe details how to make Lamb Burgers with a Lemon-Caper Aioli and Fennel Slaw. The lamb patties are seasoned and cooked, while the aioli is prepared with capers, mayonnaise, lemon, mustard, and garlic. The refreshing slaw combines thinly sliced celery, fennel, sweet onion, lemon juice, and dried mint. The burgers are assembled on toasted rolls with the lamb patty, a generous spread of aioli, a mound of slaw, and a few boquerones (marinated white anchovies) for serving.
