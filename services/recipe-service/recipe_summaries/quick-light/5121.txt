This recipe for "Bucatini with Butter-Roasted Tomato Sauce" features a rich, low-maintenance sauce made by roasting canned whole peeled tomatoes, garlic, anchovy fillets, butter, and red pepper flakes until jammy. The roasted sauce is then combined with al dente bucatini (or spaghetti) and served with Parmesan. The roasting process enhances the depth of flavor, creating a "long-cooked" taste, and the sauce can be prepared up to four days in advance. Beyond pasta, the versatile sauce is suggested for use in tomato soup, omelets, or as a pizza base.
