This recipe details how to make Cherry Compote by cooking fresh pitted cherries with orange juice, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. The fruit is strained, and the infused juices are thickened with cornstarch before being combined with the reserved cherries. The compote is then chilled for at least 2 hours and can be prepared up to two days in advance.
