This is a quick, no-cook dish featuring cooked shrimp, broccoli florets, arugula, and tofu noodles tossed in a light, creamy lemon dressing. The dressing is made from nonfat yogurt, reduced-fat sour cream, fresh chives, tarragon, garlic, Dijon mustard, and lemon zest and juice, offering a fresh, herbaceous, and zesty flavor.
