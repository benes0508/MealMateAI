Chickpea Sundal is a quick and simple plant-based dish, likely South Indian-inspired. It features chickpeas warmed with a fragrant tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, dried chiles, and optional asafetida in coconut oil. Seasoned with salt, it's topped with fresh or shredded coconut and served with lime wedges for a bright, flavorful finish.
