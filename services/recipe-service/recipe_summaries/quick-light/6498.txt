This recipe details how to make Tortilla Soup, a flavorful Mexican-inspired chicken soup. It involves simmering chicken with aromatics and dried chiles to create a rich broth, which is then reduced and seasoned with lime juice. Separately, corn tortillas are fried until crispy, and fresh corn kernels are charred. The shredded chicken is added back to the broth, and the soup is served warm, generously garnished with the crispy tortilla strips, charred corn, fresh cilantro, tomatoes, avocado, and crumbled queso fresco. It can be prepared up to two days in advance.
