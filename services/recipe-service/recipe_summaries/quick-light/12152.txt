This recipe details how to make **Homemade Flour Tortillas** from scratch. It involves combining all-purpose flour and salt, cutting in lard, then adding vegetable oil and warm water to form a dough. After kneading and resting for an hour, the dough is divided into 12 pieces, rolled thinly into 7-inch rounds, and cooked on a hot griddle or comal until browned and puffed. The tortillas are then stacked and can be frozen for later use.
