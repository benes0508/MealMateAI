A vibrant side dish featuring sugar snap peas and potatoes, tossed with a homemade parsley pesto. The pesto is made by blending fresh parsley, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil. The potatoes are boiled until tender, sugar snap peas are quickly sautÃ©ed until crisp-tender, and then both vegetables are gently combined with the freshly made pesto.
