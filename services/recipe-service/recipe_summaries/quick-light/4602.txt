This recipe is for a **Creamy Lamb's-Quarters Gratin**, a baked dish featuring blanched and chopped lamb's-quarters greens combined with saut√©ed scallions in a rich, nutmeg and lemon-zest infused white sauce. The mixture is spread in a baking dish, topped with a mix of coarse breadcrumbs, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, then baked until golden and bubbling. Components can be prepared a day ahead.
