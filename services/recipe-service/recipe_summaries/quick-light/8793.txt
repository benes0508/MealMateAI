This recipe details how to prepare **Memphis-Style Barbecued Pork Ribs**. It involves preparing St. Louis style pork spare ribs by removing the membrane and trimming excess fat, then seasoning them with salt and Neely's Barbecue Seasoning before refrigerating. The ribs are slow-cooked on a grill (ideally with hickory and charcoal) at 250Â°F using indirect heat for about 3.5 hours until tender. They can be served "dry" with extra seasoning or "wet" with Neely's Barbecue Sauce.
