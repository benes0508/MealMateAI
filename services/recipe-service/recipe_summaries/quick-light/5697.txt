This recipe for Italian Vegetable Stew combines saut√©ed carrots, celery, leeks, garlic, and red pepper flakes with crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, cannellini beans, and blanched collard greens and kale. Simmered with herbs like thyme and bay leaf, it's finished by stirring in dried sourdough bread and olive oil just before serving, and garnished with shaved Parmesan.
