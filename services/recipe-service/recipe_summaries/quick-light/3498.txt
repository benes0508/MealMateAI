This recipe features grilled King Trumpet mushrooms on skewers, glazed with a homemade sweet and savory tare sauce made from mirin, sake, soy sauce, and sugar. The mushrooms are grilled until golden, then brushed with the tare until tender and glazed, and finally topped with crisp scallions. It's a plant-based, Japanese-inspired dish.
