This recipe details how to temper chocolate using a double boiler method, ensuring a glossy finish and stable texture. It involves heating two-thirds of the chopped chocolate to specific temperatures (max 120°F for dark, 105°F for milk/white), then stirring in the remaining chocolate until cooled to 82°F. Finally, it's gently reheated to precise working temperatures (88-91°F for dark, 85-87°F for milk/white). A wax paper test confirms proper tempering, and guidelines for re-warming tempered chocolate are provided. Confectionery coatings are mentioned as an easier substitute, though they don't fully replicate true tempered chocolate.
