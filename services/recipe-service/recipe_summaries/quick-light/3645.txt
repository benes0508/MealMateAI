This recipe creates a savory spread for toast. Diced yellow tomatoes and shallots are cooked until reduced, then pur√©ed with butter and fresh marjoram to form a unique tomato-butter. This is spread on toasted baguette slices, topped with fresh tomato, and seasoned with sea salt and pepper. The tomato-butter can be made ahead and stored.
