This recipe for Smoked Bison Back Ribs involves seasoning them with a savory rub (lemon pepper, garlic salt, cayenne, rosemary, thyme), then cooking them low and slow at 230-250°F for 2.5-3 hours until pull-apart tender. The ribs are then finished with multiple glazes of barbecue sauce at a higher heat (350-400°F) before resting and serving.
