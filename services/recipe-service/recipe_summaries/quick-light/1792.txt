This "Use-It-Up Frittata" recipe is designed to incorporate leftover cooked vegetables, grains (or shelled peas/beans), and cheese, along with fresh herbs and eggs. The frittata is cooked in a nonstick skillet, initially agitated to form curds, then slowly cooked until set before being inverted and briefly cooked on the second side. It can be made a day ahead and served at room temperature.
