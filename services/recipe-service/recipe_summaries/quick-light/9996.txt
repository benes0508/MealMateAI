This Passover Pasta Primavera features homemade matzo pasta, crafted from matzo cake meal, eggs, and water, then cut into strips. It's combined with a saut√© of fresh spring vegetables including asparagus, zucchini, peas (optional), and scallions. The dish is finished with Parmigiano Reggiano, lemon zest, and a touch of pasta cooking water for a light sauce.
