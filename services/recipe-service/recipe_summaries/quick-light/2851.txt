This Spring Minestrone Verde is a light, flavorful soup featuring a vibrant pistachio pesto. It's built on a soffritto base with seasonal green vegetables like sugar snap peas, kale, and fresh peas, along with cannellini beans. The unique pesto, made with toasted pistachios, basil, parsley, and lemon zest, adds a bright, herbaceous finish. Served with toasted country bread, making it a complete meal.
