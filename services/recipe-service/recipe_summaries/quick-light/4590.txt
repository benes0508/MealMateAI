This recipe details how to make Kansas City-Style Baby Back Ribs. It involves preparing pork ribs with a dry rub of brown sugar and spices, then slow-baking them, first covered, then uncovered, while basting with a homemade sweet, tangy, and savory Kansas City-style BBQ sauce (featuring ketchup, molasses, vinegar, onion, and garlic). A final broil achieves a browned exterior, and the tender ribs are served with extra pur√©ed sauce.
