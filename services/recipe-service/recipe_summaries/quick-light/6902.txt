Spicy Seattle Tuna Rolls are sushi-style rolls featuring sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna tossed in a fiery dressing made from pur√©ed green Thai chiles, ginger, garlic, and sesame seeds, seasoned with oils and vinegar. This spicy tuna mixture is then spread over short-grain rice on nori sheets, optionally topped with fresh fillings like scallions or cucumber, and rolled into cones or logs.
