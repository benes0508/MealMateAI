This recipe details a Rigatoni dish featuring pan-seared Brussels sprouts and leeks. The pasta is tossed in a bright, savory sauce made from a reduction of white wine, lemon zest, garlic, and additional leeks, enriched with Parmesan cheese and pasta cooking water to create a glossy finish. The dish is completed with fresh Parmesan, reserved lemon zest, and a drizzle of olive oil.
