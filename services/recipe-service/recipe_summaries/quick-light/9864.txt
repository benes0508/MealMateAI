Mini Zucchini and Goat Cheese Tarts are individual savory tarts. Made with chilled pie crust rounds, they feature a base of soft goat cheese topped with artfully arranged, thinly sliced zucchini (pre-salted and dried). Finished with Parmesan, they are baked until golden. These tarts can be prepared ahead and served warm or at room temperature.
