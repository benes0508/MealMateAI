This recipe, "Butt in a Bag," outlines how to prepare a bone-in pork shoulder by smoking it low and slow over wood chips. The pork is seasoned with a simple salt and pepper rub, initially smoked to develop a flavorful bark, then enclosed in a brown paper bag for the final hours of cooking until it is exceptionally tender and easily pulled from the bone. It's ideal for serving as classic pulled pork, sliced, or chopped barbecue.
