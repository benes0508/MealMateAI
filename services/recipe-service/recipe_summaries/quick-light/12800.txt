This recipe details how to make **Balsamic Roasted Potato Wedges**. Yellow-fleshed potatoes are cut into wedges, tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roasted at 450Â°F until golden brown. Balsamic vinegar is added in two stages: first during roasting to evaporate and glaze, then again just before serving for a final tangy finish.
