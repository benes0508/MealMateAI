This recipe details how to prepare a Holiday Ham with a rich Riesling and Mustard glaze. A whole cured smoked bone-in ham is slow-baked at 300°F with a Riesling and water mixture. Concurrently, a savory-sweet glaze is prepared by reducing Riesling with shallots, thyme, butter, then blending with whole grain mustard, honey, pepper, and salt. The ham is then brushed with this glaze, and baked at 350°F until golden brown and cooked through. After resting, it's served with its skimmed pan juices.
