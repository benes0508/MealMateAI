This Challah Bread recipe guides you through making two loaves using a stand mixer. Key steps include activating yeast, mixing it with flour, sugar, oil, salt, and eggs, then kneading the dough. The dough undergoes two initial rises, followed by shaping into braided loaves (using a hashtag pattern), a final rise, an egg wash, and baking at 350Â°F for 35-40 minutes until golden brown.
