This recipe details how to make homemade grilled flatbreads. The process involves activating yeast and kneading a simple dough, followed by a 1-hour rise. The dough is then divided, rolled out, brushed with olive oil, and seasoned with a tabil spice blend, salt, and pepper. Finally, the flatbreads are grilled for 1-1.5 minutes per side until lightly charred and cooked through, then cut into wedges.
