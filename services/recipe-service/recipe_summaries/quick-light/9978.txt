Potato-Bacon Hash is a hearty dish combining crispy bacon and tender potatoes. It's prepared by cooking bacon, then simmering diced potatoes, white scallions, and garlic in the rendered bacon fat until tender. Finally, the crumbled bacon is added back and cooked until the hash is crispy, then garnished with green scallions.
