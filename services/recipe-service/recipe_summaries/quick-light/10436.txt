This recipe features penne pasta served with a rich tomato and prosciutto sauce. The sauce is made by saut√©ing red onion, garlic, and finely chopped prosciutto, then simmering with Italian plum tomatoes and a touch of sugar for 45-60 minutes, followed by an 8-hour chilling period to deepen flavors. Penne is cooked al dente, then tossed with some sauce, with additional sauce served on the side, garnished with Parmigiano Reggiano.
