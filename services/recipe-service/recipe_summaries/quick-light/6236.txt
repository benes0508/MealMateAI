This recipe for **Homemade Fresh Chorizo** involves rehydrating toasted New Mexico chiles and blending them with garlic, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to create a paste. This paste is then gently mixed with ground pork. The chorizo is cooked in a cast-iron skillet until browned and cooked through, with a note to avoid overworking the meat. It can be prepared one day in advance.
