This recipe details how to make **Algerian Flatbread**. It involves preparing a soft whole wheat dough with salt and olive oil, letting it rest, then dividing it into pieces. Each piece is rolled thinly, spread with a spiced oil mixture (cumin, paprika, turmeric, olive oil), rolled into a cylinder, and coiled into a spiral. Finally, these spirals are rolled out into flatbreads and cooked on a dry cast-iron skillet until puffed and browned.
