Lemon and Parsley Skillet-Roasted Fingerling Potatoes is a savory side dish. Fingerling potatoes are first boiled in a skillet with lemon juice, salt, and butter until tender, then rapidly boiled to reduce liquid. The potatoes are then pan-fried in batches until deeply browned and finished by tossing with fresh parsley and additional butter.
