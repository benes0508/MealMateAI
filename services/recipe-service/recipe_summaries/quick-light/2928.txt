Roasted Tomatoâ€“Cashew Salsa is a vibrant salsa recipe featuring roasted tomatoes, toasted cashews, and dried chiles (cascabel/pasilla and morita). The preparation involves separately toasting the cashews and chiles, and roasting the tomatoes until their skin browns. All ingredients are then blended, with garlic, lime juice, and salt added initially, followed by the chiles and then the cashews, pulsed to a coarsely chopped texture. This salsa can be prepared up to two days in advance.
