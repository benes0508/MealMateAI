This recipe is for a **Crispy Potato-Leek Kugel**, a savory casserole combining two forms of russet potatoes (mashed and grated) with saut√©ed leeks, onion, garlic, eggs, and thyme. The mixture is baked in a preheated, oiled pan, topped with seasoned potato slices for an extra crispy crust, then finished under the broiler.
