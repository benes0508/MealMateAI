Herbed Pumpkin Seed Mole (Mole Verde con Hierbas) is a vibrant Mexican sauce. It's prepared by toasting and grinding pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano, then combining this with a purée of sautéed tomatillos, onion, garlic, and jalapeños, blended with fresh cilantro, parsley, and chicken broth. The mixture is then simmered until the flavors are well combined.
