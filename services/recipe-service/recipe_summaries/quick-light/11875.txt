This recipe features a blend of sautéed button, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms, along with charred red bell peppers. These are then marinated overnight in a vibrant, piquant sauce. The escabèche base combines white wine and sherry vinegars with chiles de árbol, sautéed onions, garlic, honey, Worcestershire, and aromatics like bay leaves and thyme. Served chilled, it's an excellent make-ahead appetizer or side dish.
