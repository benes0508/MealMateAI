This recipe features skillet-charred green, romano, or wax beans quickly cooked until crisp-tender with charred spots. They are served over a rich, savory miso butter (made with miso, butter, serrano chile, and ginger) which melts into a flavorful sauce from the beans' residual heat. Finished with toasted sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime, it makes for a quick and vibrant side dish.
