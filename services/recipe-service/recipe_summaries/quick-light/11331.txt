This recipe details preparing a **Spice-Rubbed Turkey with Cognac Gravy**. Aromatic spices (coriander, cumin, peppercorns, cinnamon, salt, smoked paprika) are toasted, ground, and rubbed onto the turkey, which is then refrigerated overnight. The turkey is roasted, initially at 450°F then 350°F, with added broth and eventually covered with foil, until it reaches 175°F internal temperature, then rested. A rich gravy is made by simmering the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard for a flavorful broth, then deglazing the roasting pan with dry white vermouth and Cognac. This liquid is combined with defatted pan juices and giblet broth, thickened with a roux made from turkey fat and flour, and finished with the chopped giblets, creating a savory accompaniment for the carved turkey.
