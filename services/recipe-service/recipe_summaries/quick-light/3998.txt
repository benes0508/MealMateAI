This "Best-Ever Grilled Cheese" recipe features a unique technique of spreading mayonnaise on the bread's exterior for an extra golden, crispy crust. Made with white bread, American or cheddar cheese, and butter, it's cooked on a skillet until both sides are golden brown and the cheese is perfectly melted. Best enjoyed immediately, ideally with tomato soup.
