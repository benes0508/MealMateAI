This is a skillet-cooked frittata featuring tender baby eggplant, briny green olives, and fresh basil. Half of a creamy herb-and-garlic Boursin cheese is whisked into the egg mixture, with the remaining half sprinkled on top for a rich finish. The dish begins by saut√©ing eggplant until tender, then pouring over the egg mixture and cooking on the stovetop until fully set.
