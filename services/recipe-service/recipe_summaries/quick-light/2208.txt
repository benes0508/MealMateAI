This recipe features pan-seared pork shoulder (or chops) served with a sweet and savory pineapple sauce, complemented by roasted sesame broccoli. The pork is seared, then rested, while pineapple is cooked in the same pan with its juices, butter, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce. Broccoli is blanched, then roasted with shallots, olive oil, and sesame seeds until crisp-tender, and finally tossed with the pineapple and pork juices.
