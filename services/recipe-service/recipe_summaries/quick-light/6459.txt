A savory, melty Queso Fundido featuring crispy Spanish chorizo, aromatic sautéed vegetables (onion, garlic, bell pepper, jalapeño), and refried pinto beans. The mixture is generously combined with Manchego or Monterey Jack cheese, then broiled until golden and bubbling, perfect for serving with corn tortilla chips.
