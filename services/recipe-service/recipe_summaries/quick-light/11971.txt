This recipe features steamed asparagus stalks wrapped in truffle butter-coated prosciutto slices. The asparagus is first steamed until crisp-tender, then chilled and dried. Softened butter is infused with truffle oil, then thinly spread on prosciutto pieces before they are wrapped around the asparagus.
