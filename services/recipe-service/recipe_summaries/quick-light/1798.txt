This is a quick and easy Spicy Peanut Sauce. It features peanut butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, and hoisin sauce. The process involves briefly sautÃ©ing garlic and chili flakes, then whisking in the remaining ingredients, boiling, and simmering until thickened (about 1 minute). It can be prepared up to 3 days in advance and served warm or at room temperature.
