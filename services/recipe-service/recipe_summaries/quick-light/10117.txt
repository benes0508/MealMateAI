This recipe creates a dessert spring roll featuring a unique filling of kumquat-infused bittersweet chocolate ganache, enriched with Grand Marnier and butter. The ganache is chilled and cut into bars, then wrapped in spring roll wrappers, sealed with egg wash, and deep-fried until golden brown. Serve warm.
