Belgian Onion Soup is a rich, savory soup featuring deeply caramelized onions, garlic, and shallots, distinctively deglazed with Chimay Blue beer. It's then simmered in vegetable stock with bay leaves and thyme. For optimal flavor, it's suggested to rest the soup overnight before serving hot, traditionally topped with broiled sourdough bread and melted Gruy√®re cheese.
