This recipe for Beet-Pickled Deviled Eggs features hard-boiled eggs marinated in a vibrant beet pickling liquid, infusing the whites with a beautiful pink hue and a tangy flavor. The yolks are mashed with mayonnaise, fresh herbs (like basil, tarragon, chives), and a hint of anchovy paste for umami. They are then garnished with thinly sliced, briefly pickled hot chiles and additional herbs for a spicy kick and fresh aroma.
