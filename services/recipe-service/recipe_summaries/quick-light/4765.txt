This recipe features red potatoes prepared Hasselback-style (thinly sliced almost all the way through), generously flavored with garlic (pushed into the slits), olive oil, salt, and pepper. The potatoes are then baked at 375Â°F for 60-70 minutes until tender and browned. Chopped shallots are an optional addition.
