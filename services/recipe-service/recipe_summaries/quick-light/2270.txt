This recipe details how to make a Miso-Tahini Squash Soup with Brown Rice. It involves first cooking brown rice separately. Meanwhile, ginger and garlic are saut√©ed, then vegetable broth, kabocha or butternut squash, and kale are added and simmered until tender. A smooth mixture of white miso paste, tahini, and sesame oil is whisked in off the heat. The soup is served immediately over the cooked brown rice, garnished with scallions, sesame seeds, nori, and optional chili oil. It can be made ahead and reheated gently.
