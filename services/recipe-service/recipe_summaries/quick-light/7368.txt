This recipe for **Candied Orange Sticks** involves preparing orange peels by boiling them multiple times to soften and remove bitterness. The softened peels are then simmered in a sugar syrup until fully candied and the liquid evaporates. After drying for 24 hours (or in a low oven), the candied orange sticks are optionally dipped in melted dark chocolate and allowed to set. They can be stored for several months before dipping, or up to 3 weeks after being chocolate-coated.
