This recipe is for **Five-Spice Beet Soup**, a vibrant, smooth soup featuring beets as the main ingredient. Beets are first microwaved until tender, while red onion and celery are sautéed. All ingredients are then combined with vegetable broth, simmered with ginger and Chinese five-spice powder, and puréed until creamy. It's seasoned to taste and served warm, often topped with sour cream or yogurt and fresh celery leaves.
