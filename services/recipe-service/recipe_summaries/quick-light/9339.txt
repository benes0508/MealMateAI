This recipe details how to create "Dulce de Leche Half-Moons," an edible confection. It involves painting edible wafer papers with food coloring (or water for white), spreading them with dulce de leche (or similar), folding them into half-moon shapes, and then inserting toasted pumpkin seeds before the dulce de leche sets.
