This recipe details how to prepare classic Matzo Balls. Eggs are beaten with schmaltz, salt, pepper, and baking powder, then combined with matzo meal. The mixture is shaped into 1.25-inch balls (which double in size when cooked) and simmered in salted water for 25 minutes. They are traditionally served warm in soup.
