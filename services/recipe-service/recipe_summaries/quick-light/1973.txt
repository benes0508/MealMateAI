This recipe details how to make **Beet and Radish Pickles**. It involves combining sliced beets and radishes with a hot brine made from toasted fennel seeds, distilled white vinegar, kosher salt, sugar, and water. After pouring the brine over the vegetables, the mixture is cooled, then chilled for at least 8 hours before serving. The pickles can be prepared up to a week in advance and stored chilled.
