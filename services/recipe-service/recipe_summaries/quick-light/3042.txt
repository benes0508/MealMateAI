This recipe details braising artichokes in a flavorful tomato and white wine sauce. Artichokes are first cleaned and rubbed with a savory pesto made from anchovies, garlic, and mint, then simmered in a Dutch oven with crushed tomatoes, white wine, olive oil, and red pepper flakes until tender. The sauce is then reduced and spooned over the finished artichokes.
