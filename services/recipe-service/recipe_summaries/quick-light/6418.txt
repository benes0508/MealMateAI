Green Bean, Corn, and Coconut Stir-Fry (Thoren) is a vegetarian dish featuring green beans and corn. It's prepared by first making a fragrant paste from grated dried coconut, ground spices (cumin, coriander, cayenne, turmeric), fresh green chile, garlic, water, and salt. The stir-fry begins by tempering mustard seeds and red pepper flakes in oil (with optional curry leaves), then stir-frying the vegetables before adding the coconut-spice mixture and cooking until tender.
