"Penne Without the Vodka" is a vegetarian twist on penne alla vodka, replacing vodka with white grape juice. It features penne pasta coated in a creamy, puréed tomato sauce made with plum tomatoes, tomato sauce, grape juice, and heavy cream, enriched with sautéed onion and garlic. The dish is layered with pasta, tossed with the sauce, and topped with mozzarella, fresh basil, and red pepper flakes before serving.
