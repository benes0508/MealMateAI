This recipe details a method for preparing **Long-Cooked Green Beans**, first blanched then braised for 30 minutes. They are simmered with saut√©ed Spanish onions, garlic, bay leaf, and a dried red chile in a generous amount of olive oil, chicken stock, and balsamic vinegar, resulting in exceptionally tender, rich, savory, and subtly spicy beans with bright acidity.
