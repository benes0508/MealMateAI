This recipe details how to prepare pan-seared scallops, finished with a flavorful herbed brown butter sauce. Scallops are seared until golden, then basted with butter and herbs (like tarragon, lemon thyme, or sage) until cooked through and the butter is nutty brown, brightened with a touch of fresh lemon juice.
