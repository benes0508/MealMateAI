This recipe for Chowchow describes a tangy, crunchy pickled relish. It's made by salting a mixture of chopped cabbage, green tomatoes, onion, and bell peppers to draw out moisture, then simmering them in a flavorful pickling liquid of apple cider and white vinegars, sugar, mustard, turmeric, and garlic. The relish is cooked briefly to meld flavors while retaining vegetable crunch, then cooled and jarred. It can be stored chilled for up to a month or made shelf-stable by water bath canning.
