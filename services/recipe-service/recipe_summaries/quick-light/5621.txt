This recipe details how to make **Pressed Coppa Sandwiches with Broccoli Rabe Pesto**. It involves first preparing a savory-sweet pesto from blanched and slow-cooked broccoli rabe, garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, pecorino, and honey. Sandwiches are then assembled with country-style bread, provolone, coppa (or prosciutto), and the homemade pesto, before being pressed and toasted in a skillet or panini press until golden and melted.
