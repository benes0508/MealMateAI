This recipe for Chocolate and Hazelnut Spread involves toasting blanched hazelnuts and processing them into a smooth paste. Dark chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, and hazelnut oil are gently melted and then combined with the hazelnut paste. A pinch of salt and hot water are added and blended to achieve a thick, spreadable consistency, ideal for jarring.
