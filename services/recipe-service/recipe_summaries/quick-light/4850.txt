Amatriciana is a classic Italian pasta dish featuring guanciale (cured pork cheek), tomatoes, and Pecorino Romano cheese. The guanciale is rendered and saut√©ed with optional onion, then simmered with tomatoes and chile to create a rich sauce. This sauce is then tossed with al dente pasta and grated Pecorino before serving immediately.
