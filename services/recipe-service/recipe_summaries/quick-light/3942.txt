This recipe details how to achieve perfectly crispy skin on fish fillets like branzino or black bass. The key steps involve drying the fish uncovered in the fridge for an hour before cooking, then searing it skin-side down in a very hot, lightly oiled stainless steel skillet, applying firm pressure to ensure even contact. The fish is flipped and finished briefly off the heat.
