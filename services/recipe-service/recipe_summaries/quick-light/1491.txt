This recipe details how to prepare a **Mustard-Crusted Boneless Prime Rib Roast** served with a **Cream Sauce**. A 6-pound prime rib is first seasoned and slow-roasted at 225°F until it reaches 120°F (approx. 3.5-4 hours), then rested. For the crust, it's coated with a Dijon mustard-butter mixture and more steak seasoning, then seared at 500°F for 5-10 minutes until browned. The accompanying cream sauce is a blend of sour cream, horseradish, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper.
