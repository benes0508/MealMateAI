This recipe is for **Jalapeño Pepper Jelly**, a sweet and spicy condiment. It combines finely chopped jalapeños and green bell peppers with organic cane sugar, apple cider vinegar, and liquid pectin. The peppers are processed, then boiled with sugar and vinegar before pectin is added to set the jelly. The recipe yields three ½-pint jars, suitable for refrigeration (up to 3 months) or canning for longer storage.
