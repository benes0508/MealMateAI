Kiribath is a traditional Sri Lankan coconut milk rice dish. White rice is first cooked with water until absorbed, then salt and coconut milk are added and cooked until fully absorbed. The moist rice is then pressed onto a platter, flattened, and cut into diamond or square shapes before serving, often with traditional Sri Lankan sambols.
