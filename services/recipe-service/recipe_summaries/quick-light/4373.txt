This recipe details a quick preparation of instant couscous, rehydrated with spiced chicken broth (paprika, cumin, turmeric). While the couscous rests, sliced almonds are saut√©ed in olive oil until golden. The fluffed couscous is then topped with these toasted almonds and their oil, along with dried currants for a sweet contrast. It's a fast, flavorful side dish.
