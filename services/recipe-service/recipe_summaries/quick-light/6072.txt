This recipe is for a traditional Spanish Tortilla, a thick omelet made primarily from slow-cooked tender potatoes and onions, mixed with beaten eggs. The mixture is cooked in an ovenproof skillet, first on the stovetop until set, then finished briefly under a broiler. After cooking, it's inverted onto a plate and allowed to rest before serving, often at room temperature.
