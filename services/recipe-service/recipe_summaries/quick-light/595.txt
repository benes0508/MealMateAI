Chile Crisp is an aromatic, spicy, and savory condiment featuring crispy fried shallots and garlic infused in oil with cinnamon and star anise. This flavorful oil and the crispy bits are then combined with a base of red pepper flakes, fresh ginger, soy sauce, and sugar. It can be made ahead and stored for up to one month.
