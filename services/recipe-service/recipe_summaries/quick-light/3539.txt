This recipe details how to make a dairy-free "ice cream" from frozen bananas, creamy peanut butter, and grape jelly. Frozen banana slices are pur√©ed until creamy in a food processor, then blended with peanut butter. Grape jelly is pulsed in at the end to create a speckled appearance. It is served immediately, with the option to freeze bananas in advance.
