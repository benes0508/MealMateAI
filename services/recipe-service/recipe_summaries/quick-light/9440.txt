This recipe details an Asian noodle dish featuring rich, "barbecued" duck confit. Duck legs are roasted and broiled with a sweet and savory hoisin-based glaze until lightly charred. Rice vermicelli noodles, blanched carrots, and green beans are tossed in a zesty, aromatic Asian dressing with fresh herbs and scallions.
