This recipe details how to make Cantaloupe and Black Pepper Granita. It involves pur√©eing cantaloupe, sugar, a sweet dessert wine (like Muscat), and black pepper, then freezing the mixture in a shallow dish. As it freezes, the granita is periodically scraped with a fork (for 2-4 hours) until it achieves a fluffy, shaved ice consistency. It's served topped with coarsely ground black pepper and can be prepared up to 3 days ahead.
