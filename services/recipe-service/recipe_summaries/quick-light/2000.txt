This recipe features **broiled red snapper fillets** with a vibrant and flavorful **Za'atar Salsa Verde**. The salsa verde combines fresh cilantro, parsley, garlic, olive oil, and crushed red pepper flakes with the distinctive notes of **za'atar**, **fresh lemon juice**, and **finely chopped pickled banana peppers**. Toasted pine nuts add a final crunchy texture. The snapper is broiled until its skin is crisp and browned, then topped with the prepared salsa verde.
