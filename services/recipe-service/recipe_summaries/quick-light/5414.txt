A simple, fresh pasta dish featuring pasta, tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. The no-cook sauce combines chopped tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil, subtly infused with garlic by rubbing the bowl. The mixture melds flavors before being tossed with hot, al dente pasta. The tomato mixture can be prepped up to 8 hours ahead.
