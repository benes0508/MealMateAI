A sophisticated recipe for roasted veal chops, first seared and then oven-finished to a medium-rare. They are served with rehydrated, sautéed morel mushrooms and a rich pan sauce. The sauce is created in the same skillet, deglazing with Cognac, incorporating the reserved morel liquid, and finished with crème fraîche, chives, and tarragon.
