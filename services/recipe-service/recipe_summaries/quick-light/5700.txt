This recipe details how to make a rich, custard-based Marmalade Ice Cream. It involves infusing a cream and milk base with vanilla, then thickening it with egg yolks to form a custard. After cooling, the custard is churned in an ice cream maker and finished by folding in prepared orange marmalade before freezing. It can be made up to two days in advance.
