This recipe details how to prepare fresh corn by briefly boiling it until tender, then cutting the kernels off the cob (keeping them in clusters). The corn is then gently tossed with a flavorful sauce made from melted butter, fresh lemon juice, salt, pepper, and a hint of cayenne, and finished with fresh cilantro. It's designed to be served warm or at room temperature as a simple, herb-infused side dish.
