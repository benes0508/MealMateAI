This recipe for Glazed Vegetables features root vegetables (such as beets, carrots, parsnips, or fennel) simmered with butter, honey, and water until tender. The liquid then evaporates, allowing the vegetables to brown and coat in the remaining butter and honey, creating a rich, sweet glaze, finished with a quick deglaze.
