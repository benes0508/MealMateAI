Grilled Lamb Meatballs are prepared by mixing ground lamb with soaked bulgur, grated onion, minced garlic, egg, cumin, and fresh herbs. The mixture is formed into small oval patties, skewered, brushed with olive oil, and then grilled or broiled for 4-5 minutes per side until cooked. Serve hot, optionally with a dipping sauce.
