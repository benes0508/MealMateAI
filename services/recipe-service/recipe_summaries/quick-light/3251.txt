This recipe features blanched and saut√©ed Brussels sprouts topped with a rich, chunky bacon jam. The bacon jam is made by cooking thick-cut bacon with onion, garlic, sugar, dried apricots, sherry vinegar, and herbs until syrupy, then pureeing it. The Brussels sprouts are quickly blanched, then pan-fried until tender and browned. Each sprout half is then topped with a spoonful of the homemade bacon jam and served skewered.
