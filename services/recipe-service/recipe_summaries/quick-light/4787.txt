This recipe for Charred Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta and Fig Glaze involves crisping diced pancetta in a pan, then charring halved Brussels sprouts in the same pan with olive oil and salt until tender. A fig jam and water mixture is added to create a glaze, and the reserved crispy pancetta is stirred back in before serving.
