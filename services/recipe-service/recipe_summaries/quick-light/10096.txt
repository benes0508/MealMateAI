This Rhubarb Compote features fresh rhubarb simmered in a red wine (Pinot Noir or Cabernet Sauvignon) syrup, infused with orange and lemon peels, and sweetened with sugar. The rhubarb is cooked until tender, then removed while the syrup reduces, before being reunited and chilled. It can be prepared a day in advance.
