This recipe for **Mint Lollipops** involves making a mint-infused sugar syrup. Water and mint leaves are blended and strained to create a mint liquid. This liquid is then boiled with sugar and corn syrup until it reaches 300Â°F (hard-crack stage). Peppermint/spearmint extract is added, and the hot syrup is poured onto baking sheets around lollipop sticks, then cooled until hardened.
