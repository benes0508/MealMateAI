This is a vibrant vegetarian dish combining three types of peas (sugar snap, English, pea shoots) with pearl barley. It's dressed in an Asian-inspired sauce featuring rice vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, and sambal oelek (chile paste) for a savory, sweet, and spicy flavor profile, enhanced by green garlic, green onions, and kaffir lime leaves. The preparation involves blanching peas, cooking barley, then stir-frying all components with the sauce.
