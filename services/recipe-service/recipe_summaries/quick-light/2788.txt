This recipe features grilled leafy greens (such as Swiss chard, Tuscan kale, or escarole) tossed with a homemade spicy garlic oil. The oil is prepared by simmering garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes until the garlic is golden. The greens are then massaged with this flavorful oil and quickly grilled until lightly charred and tender.
