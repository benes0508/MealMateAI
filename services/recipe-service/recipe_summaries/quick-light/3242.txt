"Tonnarelli a Cacio e Pepe" is a classic Roman pasta dish featuring tonnarelli (or spaghetti) tossed vigorously with a rich sauce. The sauce is created by emulsifying Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano cheeses with freshly ground black pepper, a touch of olive oil and butter, and especially starchy pasta cooking water, resulting in a creamy, peppery, cheesy consistency without the addition of cream.
