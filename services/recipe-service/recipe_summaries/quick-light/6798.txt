Fried Chickpeas are a crispy, savory snack or side dish made by sautÃ©ing dried canned chickpeas in olive oil until golden and crisp (about 15-20 minutes). They are seasoned with a smoky, spicy blend of smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, then finished with salt and fresh lime zest for a bright, zesty counterpoint.
