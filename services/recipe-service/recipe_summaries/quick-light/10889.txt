This recipe creates **Ros√©-Water Candied Peanuts**, a sweet and aromatic snack. Dry roasted peanuts are cooked in a sugar syrup until golden brown and crystallized, then infused with Middle Eastern rose water for a distinctive floral flavor. The resulting nuts are crisp, sweet, and have a unique, slightly gritty texture.
