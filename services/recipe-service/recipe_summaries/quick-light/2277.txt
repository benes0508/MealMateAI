This recipe features pan-roasted salmon with a vibrant grapefruit-cabbage slaw. Salmon fillets are cooked skin-side down until crisp, then flipped. The slaw combines grapefruit segments, thinly sliced savoy cabbage, and diced avocado, tossed in a dressing of grapefruit juice, shallot, and Greek yogurt, seasoned with salt and pepper, and garnished with fresh cilantro.
