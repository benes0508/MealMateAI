This sophisticated dish features pan-fried striped bass served alongside two flavorful accompaniments: vibrant saffron-infused vegetables (cauliflower, yellow squash, radishes) simmered in broth with a fragrant spiced butter, and a savory broccoli rabe tossed with a pungent puree of roasted garlic, olives, capers, raisins, anchovies, and red pepper.
