This recipe details how to make a Cantaloupe Grappa Semifreddo, a semi-frozen Italian dessert. It involves pur√©eing cantaloupe with sugar, grappa, and salt, then whisking it with egg yolks over simmering water until thick. This base is then chilled, gently folded with soft-peak whipped cream, and frozen in a loaf pan for at least 5 hours until firm, before being unmolded and served.
