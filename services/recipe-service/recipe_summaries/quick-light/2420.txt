Roast Koji Chicken features a whole chicken seasoned with a mixture of ground rice koji and salt applied under the skin and inside the cavity. After an overnight chill, the chicken is roasted at an initial high temperature (425°F) to brown the skin, then at a lower temperature (350°F) until cooked through, resulting in a flavorful and tender roast.
