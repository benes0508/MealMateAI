**Rainbow Chard Slaw** is a vibrant, healthy, and plant-based salad featuring shredded Swiss chard, purple cabbage, and carrots, tossed with almonds. It's dressed with a unique sweet and savory apple cider vinaigrette spiced with allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The slaw is finished with raw hemp seeds and dried blueberries, and benefits from chilling to allow the flavors to meld.
