This recipe details how to prepare **Cauliflower with Mustard-Lemon Butter**. Sliced cauliflower is first roasted until slightly tender, then coated with a vibrant sauce made from melted butter, lemon juice, whole grain Dijon mustard, and lemon peel. It's then roasted again until crisp-tender, finished with fresh parsley, and can be served warm or at room temperature.
