Yogurt and Persian Shallot Dip (Mast-o Musir) is a simple dip made by soaking, draining, and finely chopping dried Persian shallots (musir). These are then combined with plain yogurt, salt, pepper, and mint. It is served as an appetizer or accompaniment, optionally garnished with crushed dried rose petals or fresh mint.
