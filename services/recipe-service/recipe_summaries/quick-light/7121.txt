This is a classic Italian Pasta Al Pomodoro recipe featuring bucatini or spaghetti with a simple tomato sauce. The sauce is made by sautéing onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes, then simmering puréed tomatoes with fresh basil. The pasta is cooked al dente and finished in the skillet with the sauce, a splash of pasta water, butter, and grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese.
