This recipe features tender-boiled beets preserved in a sweet-tangy pickling brine. The brine is infused with star anise, red wine vinegar, dry red wine, sugar, and salt. After infusing, the star anise pods are removed. The hot brine is poured over packed beets, and the jars are processed in a boiling water bath for preservation. The pickled beets require at least a week to develop full flavor before consumption.
