This recipe details how to make **No-Churn Salted Caramel Ice Cream**. It involves combining either homemade (from sweetened condensed milk) or store-bought dulce de leche with sea salt, then gently folding in stiff-peaked whipped heavy cream. The mixture is frozen in a loaf pan for about 6 hours until firm, then served with additional salt. It can be made up to 7 days ahead.
