This recipe, "The Ripper’s Pasta With Uni and Caviar," creates a luxurious spaghetti dish. A rich sauce is made by puréeing sea urchin roe (uni) with butter, then gently warmed. Cooked al dente spaghetti is tossed with this creamy uni sauce, Parmesan cheese, and chives. Each serving is then garnished with reserved uni lobes, Iranian Osetra caviar, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
