Saffron Pilaf is a flavorful rice dish made by toasting long-grain rice in butter, simmering it in stock until tender, then stirring in saffron-infused stock. It's finished by resting and garnished with fresh parsley and cheese, serving as an excellent accompaniment to roast or braised meat or fish.
