Cranberry Quince Sauce is prepared by simmering cut quinces with their peels and cores (in cheesecloth) in a sugar syrup until tender. Fresh or frozen cranberries are then added and cooked until they burst. The mixture is drained, the liquid reduced to a syrup, and then combined with the cranberry solids to cool into a sauce.
