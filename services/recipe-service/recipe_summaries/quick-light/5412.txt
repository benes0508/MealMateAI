This recipe is for **Turkey Spinach Sliders**. It involves combining ground turkey with chopped spinach, scallions, garlic, and cumin, forming the mixture into small patties. These patties are then pan-fried until golden brown and cooked through. The sliders are served on toasted buns with mayonnaise, sliced red onion, and pickles. Patties can be prepped a day in advance.
