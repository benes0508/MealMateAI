This recipe details open-face chicken burgers featuring a homemade basil mayonnaise (made with mayonnaise, fresh basil, cornichons, green onions, and pickle brine). Ground chicken is mixed with some of this mayonnaise to form patties. Both the chicken burgers and country white bread slices are grilled. The dish is assembled by spreading basil mayonnaise on the grilled bread, then topping with tomato slices, basil leaves, a chicken burger, and an additional dollop of mayonnaise.
