This recipe creates a sophisticated appetizer or light bite. Slices of baguette are grilled until charred, then generously spread with fresh ricotta. They are topped with a vibrant, sweet-savory salsa made from fresh cherries, spring onions, lemon juice, and olive oil. The salsa can be prepared ahead of time.
