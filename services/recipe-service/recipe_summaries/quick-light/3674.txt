This recipe features corn and leeks roasted directly on hot embers or coals in a fire pit. Corn is roasted in its husk until charred, while leeks are cooked until tender and collapsed. After roasting, the corn is shucked, and the tender inner flesh of the leeks is removed. Both are then seasoned simply with unsalted butter and flaky sea salt, highlighting their smoky, sweet flavors.
