This recipe for Tomato Jam involves blanching, skinning, seeding, and chopping ripe tomatoes. The prepared tomatoes are then simmered with sugar, salt, and pepper until the mixture thickens and most of the liquid has cooked off. Fresh lemon juice is stirred in at the end to balance the flavors. The jam is then spooned into jars, cooled, and refrigerated, where it can last for at least 6 months.
