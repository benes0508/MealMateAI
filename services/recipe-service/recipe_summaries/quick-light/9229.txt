Linguine with Pesto Trapanese features a vibrant, briefly blended pesto made from saut√©ed almonds, fresh basil, garlic, ripe plum tomatoes, pecorino cheese, and olive oil. The linguine is cooked al dente and tossed with the pesto, with a touch of reserved pasta water for consistency. It is traditionally served lukewarm or at room temperature.
