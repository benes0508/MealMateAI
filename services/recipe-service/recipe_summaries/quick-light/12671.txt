This recipe is for Anchovy and Rosemary Roasted Lamb, a savory main dish. A semiboneless leg of lamb is marinated with a paste of minced garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and fresh rosemary, with some pushed into slits in the meat. After marinating at room temperature for an hour, the lamb is seasoned with salt and pepper, then roasted at 400°F for 1.5-1.75 hours until it reaches 125°F for medium-rare, followed by a 30-minute rest before slicing.
