This recipe details how to make Limoncello Tiramis√π, a no-bake Italian dessert. It involves preparing a limoncello-lemon syrup to quickly soak ladyfingers, and creating a light, citrusy cream by combining a cooked lemon-limoncello egg yolk base (zabaglione) with mascarpone, lemon zest, and folded-in whipped egg whites. The soaked ladyfingers and cream are then layered in a dish and require extensive chilling before serving.
