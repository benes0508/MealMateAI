**Shark and Bake** is a Trinidadian-inspired dish featuring pan-fried, chile-marinated fish (catfish or tilapia) served in warm pita bread. The fish is seasoned with lime, garlic, and scotch bonnet or habanero chile before being floured and cooked until golden. It's then stuffed into pita pockets with lettuce and tomato, and served with a variety of optional condiments like mango chutney or hot pepper sauce.
