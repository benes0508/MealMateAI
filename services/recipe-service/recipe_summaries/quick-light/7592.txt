This recipe features rich, slow-cooked shredded pork conserva served with a vibrant green tomato agrodolce, a sweet and sour relish. Both components can be prepared ahead of time, making it an excellent make-ahead appetizer or canape when spooned onto flatbread crackers and garnished with fresh basil.
