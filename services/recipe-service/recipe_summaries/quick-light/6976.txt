**Salt-and-Pepper Rib Eye:** A recipe for grilling bone-in rib eye. It details preparing the steak with initial salting and chilling to dry, bringing it to room temperature, then re-seasoning with salt and pepper. The steak is grilled using a two-zone method (searing over direct heat, then finishing over indirect heat) until desired doneness, followed by resting, slicing, and a final sprinkle of coarse sea salt.
