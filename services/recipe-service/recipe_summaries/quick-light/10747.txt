This recipe creates a `Frozen Mango, Blackberry Cassis, and Vanilla Mosaic` dessert. It combines softened mango sorbet and vanilla ice cream with a strained blackberry, sugar, and crème de cassis purée. These are decoratively layered in a loaf pan, then frozen until solid, and finally sliced for serving.
