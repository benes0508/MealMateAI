This is an Indian-inspired stir-fry of green beans with coconut. It begins by tempering various whole spices (like mustard seeds, cumin, and chiles) and yellow split peas in oil. Green beans are then stir-fried with some shredded coconut, followed by simmering with more coconut, optional Indian spice powder, and water until the beans are tender and all liquid has evaporated.
