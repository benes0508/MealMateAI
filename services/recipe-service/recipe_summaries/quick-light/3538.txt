This recipe details how to make homemade chocolate-dipped ice cream cones, similar to "Drumsticks." It involves coating the inside of sugar cones with melted chocolate and coconut oil, freezing them, then filling with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream top is then dipped in the remaining chocolate mixture and sprinkled with chopped peanuts, followed by a final freeze.
