This recipe details how to make **Spicy Smoked Gouda Twice-Baked Potatoes**. Russet potatoes are first baked until tender, then their fluffy insides are scooped out and mixed with a creamy filling of smoked Gouda cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, chopped pickled jalape√±os, green onions, and smoked paprika. This mixture is then spooned back into the potato skins, topped with more Gouda, and broiled until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
