This recipe details how to make a hearty **Beef and Dark Beer Chili**. It involves browning ground chuck, sautéing a mix of onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños, then combining them with toasted spices (cumin, coriander, chili powder, chipotle chiles), crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, and dark beer. The chili is simmered for 20 minutes and typically served with sour cream, green onions, and cheddar cheese. It can be prepared up to two days ahead or frozen.
