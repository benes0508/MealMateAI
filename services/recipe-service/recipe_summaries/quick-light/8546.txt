This is a fresh, spicy Mozzarella Arrabiata Salsa designed to be tossed with hot pasta. It features a blend of pur√©ed and finely chopped fresh tomatoes, infused with hot red pepper flakes and optional cherry pepper for a kick. Chopped celery adds a crisp texture, and fresh mozzarella is tossed in at the end. Served with capellini and garnished with celery leaves.
