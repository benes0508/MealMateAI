This recipe details how to prepare **Coal-Roasted Eggplants**. Two small eggplants are cooked directly on medium-heat hardwood coals (or a grill) until skins are blackened and flesh collapses. After cooling and peeling, the eggplants are drained for 30 minutes, then split lengthwise and served with a desired sauce.
