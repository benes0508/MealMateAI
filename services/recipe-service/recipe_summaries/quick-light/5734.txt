Vegetable Quesadillas with Fresh Salsa are crispy tortillas filled with a savory blend of mashed kidney beans (with chipotle), avocado, spinach, and reduced-fat cheddar. They are skillet-cooked until golden and served with a vibrant fresh salsa of diced tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, cumin, and salt.
