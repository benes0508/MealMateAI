This recipe is for a vibrant **Spring Risotto** featuring seasonal green vegetables like **asparagus, English peas, and sugar snap peas** (with optional fiddlehead ferns). It uses **Arborio or Carnaroli rice** cooked traditionally with **white wine and chicken stock**, finished with **Parmesan cheese** and a touch of **basil pesto** for a fresh, creamy dish. The recipe includes instructions for blanching the vegetables and an option to prepare the risotto ahead of time.
