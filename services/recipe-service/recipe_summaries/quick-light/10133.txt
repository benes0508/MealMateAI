This recipe details how to make light and fluffy Zuni Ricotta Gnocchi. Key steps include thoroughly draining fresh ricotta, then beating it with eggs, melted butter (optionally with sage), grated Parmigiano, and salt to create a soft batter. The gnocchi are then carefully scooped, coated in flour, and gently shaped. A crucial step involves testing a single gnocchi for consistency in simmering water, adjusting the batter if it spreads or is too heavy. The main batch is then gently simmered until firm and served immediately, tossed in a simple warm butter sauce. The recipe also provides numerous serving suggestions with various seasonal ingredients and a variation for spinach-infused gnocchi.
