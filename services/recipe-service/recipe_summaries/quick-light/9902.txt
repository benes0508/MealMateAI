This recipe for Chèvre with Candied Figs involves broiling slices of chèvre (goat cheese) until slightly melted. Concurrently, a candied fig topping is made by simmering balsamic vinegar with brown sugar and fresh (or rehydrated dried) figs until reduced. The warm chèvre is then topped with the candied figs and the balsamic reduction before serving.
