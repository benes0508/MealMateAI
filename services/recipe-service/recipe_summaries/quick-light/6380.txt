**Poached Lobster with Vegetable Macedonia** is a sophisticated dish featuring poached lobster meat combined with a vibrant medley of finely diced, blanched vegetables (carrots, turnips, French beans, peas). The mixture is tossed in a creamy, tangy sauce made from Greek yogurt, lemon juice and zest, chopped scallions, Piment d'Espelette (or hot paprika), and reserved lobster coral. The prepared salad is then artfully served chilled, often within the halved lobster shells.
