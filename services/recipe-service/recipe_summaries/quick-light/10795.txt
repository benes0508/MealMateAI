**Deviled Eggs with Horseradish and Black Pepper** are a zesty take on the classic appetizer. Hard-boiled egg yolks are processed until smooth with mayonnaise, prepared horseradish, sweet pickle juice, black pepper, and salt. The recipe includes instructions for perfectly cooking the eggs and notes that the dish can be prepared a day ahead, finished with a fresh parsley garnish.
