**Scallion Slaw:** A quick and crisp Korean-inspired side dish featuring thinly sliced scallions, prepared in an ice bath for crunch, then dressed with a vibrant blend of distilled white vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder) for a tangy, nutty, and subtly spicy flavor.
