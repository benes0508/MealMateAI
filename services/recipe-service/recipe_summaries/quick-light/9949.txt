This recipe details preparing **Veal Chops with Asparagus and Morels**. Veal chops are seared and then roasted with shallots and herbs (sage, thyme, bay leaves). Separately, asparagus is blanched, and morel mushrooms are saut√©ed. The dish is finished by combining the morels and asparagus with minced shallots, sliced sage, and garlic in a broth, then returning the veal chops to the skillet to warm through and reduce the sauce. It's garnished with fresh chives and pairs well with a lighter-style Pinot Noir.
