Green Garlic Panisse is a savory dish featuring a chickpea flour base infused with tender, translucent green garlic. The dough is cooked, spread into a pan, chilled until firm, and then cut into shapes. These pieces are then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy, often finished with a hint of Meyer lemon zest.
