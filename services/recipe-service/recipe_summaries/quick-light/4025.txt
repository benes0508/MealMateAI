This recipe details how to prepare Beer-Braised Brisket. A spice rub made with garlic, brown sugar, Dijon, and various seasonings is applied to the brisket, which then chills for 1-2 days. The brisket is slow-braised with sliced onions and lager in the oven for 5-6 hours until very tender, then finished under the broiler for a crisp exterior. It's served shredded or sliced, mixed with the braised onions and cooking liquid. The dish can be made a day ahead and reheated.
