This recipe details a rich, slow-simmered pork ragù served over creamy polenta. The ragù is made by browning pork shoulder, then simmering it for 2.5-3 hours with sautéed onions, garlic, tomato paste, red wine, crushed tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves until the pork is falling-apart tender. The creamy polenta is prepared by gradually whisking coarse polenta into boiling water, cooking until tender, then enriching it with butter and Parmesan cheese. The dish is served with the ragù spooned over the polenta, garnished with fresh parsley, more Parmesan, and olive oil. The pork ragù can be made up to 5 days in advance.
