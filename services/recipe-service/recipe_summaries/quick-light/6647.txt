This recipe for Cherry-Pistachio Nougat guides you through making a classic candy. It involves toasting pistachios, preparing a hot sugar and honey syrup, and whipping egg whites. The hot syrup is slowly streamed into the whipped egg whites to form a thick meringue base, which is then folded with the toasted pistachios and dried cherries. The nougat is spread between sheets of edible rice paper, allowed to set, and finally cut into individual pieces. It can be prepared a week in advance and stored at room temperature.
