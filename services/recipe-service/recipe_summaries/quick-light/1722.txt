This recipe for "Perfectly Roasted Potatoes" uses Yukon Gold potatoes, olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper. The potatoes are first halved and "steamed" on a baking sheet with water, covered in foil, at 425°F until tender (25-30 min). After draining the water, the oven is cranked to 500°F. The potatoes are then tossed with olive oil and seasonings and roasted, uncovered, until their skins are golden and cut sides are deeply browned and crisp (20-25 min).
