This recipe for "Vegetables Ã  la Barigoule with Vanilla" features a variety of blanched vegetables (broccoli, carrots, onions, asparagus, fennel) that are then simmered until crisp-tender in a unique broth infused with vanilla bean, garlic, coriander, peppercorns, thyme, and bay leaf. The simmering broth is later reduced to a concentrated sauce, enriched with olive oil and sherry vinegar, and poured over the vegetables. It's garnished with fresh lemon slices and cilantro.
