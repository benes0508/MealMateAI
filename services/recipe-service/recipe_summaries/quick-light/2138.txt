This no-cook recipe creates a refreshing marinated bean dish using various canned beans (e.g., cannellini, chickpeas). It combines a tangy shallot-vinegar marinade with fresh herbs, olive oil, and a touch of chili flakes, seasoned with salt. Ideal as a quick side or light meal, it can be prepared up to three days in advance.
