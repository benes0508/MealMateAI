This recipe is for **Smoked-Chili-Rubbed Goat Shoulder**. It involves making a rub from fresh red chilies, ginger, garlic, parsley, and salt, then mixing with olive oil. The goat shoulder is coated with this rub and refrigerated for 24 hours. Finally, it's smoked for 6-7 hours, basted occasionally with reserved marinade, until very tender.
