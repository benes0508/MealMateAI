This recipe is for a 3-ingredient Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bark. High-quality dark chocolate is melted with peppermint extract, spread onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and immediately sprinkled with crushed candy canes. After freezing for about 5 minutes until hardened, it's broken into pieces and served. It can be made up to 7 days ahead and stored chilled.
