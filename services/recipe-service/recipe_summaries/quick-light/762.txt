Sheet-Pan Cuban Rice and Beans is an easy one-pan meal. Bell peppers, onion, and garlic are roasted on a sheet pan, then combined with white rice, black beans, and a blend of Cuban-inspired spices (cumin, oregano, fennel, coriander). The dish is then covered and baked until the water is absorbed and the ingredients are tender.
