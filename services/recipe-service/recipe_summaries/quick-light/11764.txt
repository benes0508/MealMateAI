This recipe details how to make Asiago-Pepper Frico, which are crispy, savory cheese wafers. Shredded Asiago cheese (or a blend) is seasoned with black pepper and cayenne, then spooned into thin, 2.5-inch rounds on parchment-lined baking sheets. They are baked at 350Â°F for about 12 minutes until deep golden and crisp, then cooled. These frico can be prepared a day ahead.
