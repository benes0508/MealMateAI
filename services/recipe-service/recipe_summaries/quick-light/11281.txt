This recipe describes how to make **Parsley-Crouton Omelets with Gruyère**. It involves preparing crisp, buttery croutons seasoned with salt, and a mixture of fresh parsley and garlic. Each omelet is made by cooking beaten eggs in a carbon steel pan, then filling them with Gruyère cheese, the parsley-garlic mixture, and the homemade croutons, before folding and serving. The process is repeated to make four individual omelets.
