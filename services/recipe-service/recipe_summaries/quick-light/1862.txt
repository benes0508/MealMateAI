This recipe for "Josh Ozersky's Favorite Burger" details how to make 10 thin, flavorful smash burgers. Key ingredients include ground chuck (70-30 fat ratio preferred), American cheese, soft dinner rolls, and yellow onion. The technique involves flattening salted meatballs on a very hot skillet, adding watery onions after the first sizzle, then flipping, topping with cheese, and placing a bottom bun on top to steam before inverting onto a top bun. This method emphasizes a crispy crust and onion-infused flavor.
