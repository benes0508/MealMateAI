This recipe for "Spinach and Tofu Paneer" is a vegetarian Indian-inspired dish featuring firm or soft tofu and a large bunch of spinach. The tofu is blanched, and the spinach is steamed and pureed with a spicy aromatic base of chiles, ginger, garlic, and onion, along with cumin, nutmeg, and cayenne. The spinach-spice mixture is cooked, then combined with half-and-half and the tofu, simmered, and finished with yogurt. It's recommended to serve over basmati rice.
