This Chicken Chili recipe features a unique pureed base made from chicken broth, stewed tomatoes, chiles, onion, garlic, cilantro, and peanuts. This sauce is boiled, then combined with shredded rotisserie chicken and pink beans. The chili then simmers for 10 minutes and can be garnished with fresh cilantro and sour cream.
