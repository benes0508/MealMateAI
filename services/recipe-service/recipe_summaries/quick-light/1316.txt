This recipe provides instructions for a homemade Everything Bagel Seasoning blend. It combines poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, and coarse salt. The dry ingredients (excluding salt) are quickly toasted in a skillet for about 2 minutes until fragrant, then mixed with salt and cooled for storage. The seasoning can be stored in an airtight container for up to one month.
