Asparagus with Mussel Beurre Blanc is a sophisticated dish featuring blanched asparagus topped with a rich beurre blanc sauce. The sauce is made by reducing white wine, onion, carrot, and mussel cooking liquid, then whisking in chilled butter until emulsified. The mussels and vegetables are strained out, leaving a flavorful base for the sauce.
