This recipe prepares a multi-grain pasta dish featuring a vibrant Sicilian salsa verde (parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic, olive oil). The cooked pasta is combined with sautÃ©ed savoy cabbage and haricots verts (slender green beans), then tossed with the salsa verde, Parmesan cheese, and pasta cooking liquid for a flavorful meal.
