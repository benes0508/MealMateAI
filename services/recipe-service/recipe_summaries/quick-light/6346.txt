Potted Crab with Meyer Lemon is a chilled appetizer featuring lump crabmeat gently folded into a rich, savory butter infused with reduced Meyer lemon juice, sherry, lemon zest, and a hint of harissa or cayenne. The mixture is packed into a crock, chilled, and then served at room temperature with buttered toast points.
