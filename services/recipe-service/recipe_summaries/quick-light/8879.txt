This Creamy Polenta recipe uses whole milk, water, and salt, brought to a boil before coarse polenta is gradually whisked in. It's then simmered on low heat, stirring almost constantly, for about 18 minutes until smooth and thick. Regular yellow cornmeal can be substituted, cooking for half the time.
