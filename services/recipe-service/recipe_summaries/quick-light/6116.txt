This recipe details how to make Pickled Corn. Corn rounds are briefly boiled, then layered in a jar with garlic, red chiles, and black peppercorns. A saltwater brine is poured over the mixture, which is then left to pickle for 4-6 days at room temperature. The pickled corn can be served immediately or refrigerated for up to 3 weeks.
