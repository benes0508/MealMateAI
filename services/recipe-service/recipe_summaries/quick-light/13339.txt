This recipe is for **Honey Lavender Ice Cream**. It involves infusing a cream and half-and-half base with honey and dried lavender, straining it, then tempering in eggs to create a custard. This custard is then cooled, chilled, and finally churned in an ice cream maker before being frozen to harden.
