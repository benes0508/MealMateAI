This recipe for **Asparagus Velout√©** creates a creamy, refined asparagus soup. White asparagus pieces are simmered in chicken stock with a touch of sugar, then blended and strained to achieve a smooth consistency. The soup is then reduced, thickened with a cornstarch slurry, and enriched with a mixture of egg yolk and heavy cream before a final gentle heating, blending, and seasoning. (Note: asparagus tips are reserved for another use).
