This recipe details how to make a **Quick Chocolate-Cinnamon Mousse with Cherries**. It involves preparing a **syrup of fresh Bing cherries with cherry preserves and ruby port**, which is cooked until thick and then chilled. Separately, a **chocolate-cinnamon mousse** is made by combining warm cream and cinnamon with melted bittersweet/semisweet chocolate, then folding in whipped cream. Both components require chilling before serving, where the cherry syrup is spooned over the set mousse.
