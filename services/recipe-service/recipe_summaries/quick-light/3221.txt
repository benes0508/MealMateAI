**Dashi** is a fundamental Japanese stock made from dried **kombu** (kelp) and **bonito flakes**. The kombu is soaked, brought to a boil, then removed, after which bonito flakes are added, briefly simmered, and steeped. The resulting liquid is strained, yielding a clear, umami-rich broth used as a base for many Japanese dishes. It can be prepared up to two days in advance and chilled.
