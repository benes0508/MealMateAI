This Asian-inspired Beef Negimaki recipe features thinly sliced beef rolls filled with scallions and carrots, marinated in a blend of hoisin, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. These beef rolls are then grilled in foil packets alongside broccolini and instant brown rice, cooked with chicken broth for a complete meal.
