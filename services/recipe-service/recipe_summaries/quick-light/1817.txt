This recipe details how to make **Fried Potato and Garlic Puffs**, a savory appetizer or side dish. It involves preparing mashed russet potatoes, which are then thoroughly dried and passed through a sieve or food mill. Simultaneously, a classic pâte à choux dough is made by cooking flour with boiling water, butter, and salt, then incorporating eggs. The dried potato and pounded garlic are then mixed into the sticky choux dough. Walnut-sized dollops of this mixture are deep-fried until golden brown, resulting in airy, savory puffs. They are suggested as a pre-dinner aperitif, with optional additions like herbs, cheese, or green garlic.
