This recipe for "Real Creamed Corn Pudding" features fresh corn grated to yield a milky pulp, combined with sautéed onions and celery, egg yolks, and crème fraîche/sour cream. Stiffly beaten egg whites are folded in for a light texture. The pudding is baked in a cast-iron skillet (or baking dish) with browned butter, initially at a higher temperature (425°F) then reduced (350°F) until set and golden. It's recommended to let it stand before serving.
