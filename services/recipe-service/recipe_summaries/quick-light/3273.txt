This recipe creates a creamy, savory pasta dish featuring a sauce made from pumpkin pur√©e, heavy cream, and sweet smoked Spanish paprika. Pasta is cooked separately, while the sauce is quickly whisked in a skillet. The al dente pasta is then tossed with the smoky pumpkin sauce and fresh parsley, using reserved pasta water to achieve the desired consistency, making for a simple and comforting vegetarian meal.
