This recipe for Oka Cheese Fondue combines heavy cream, dry white wine, and ice wine with flour to create a thickened base. Oka cheese (or Port Salut) is then gradually melted into the smooth mixture. It's typically served warm in a fondue pot with dippers like cubed baguette, apple, and pear wedges.
