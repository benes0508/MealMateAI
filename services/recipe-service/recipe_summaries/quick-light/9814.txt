This recipe creates individual Tomato Tartes Tatins, a savory twist on the classic. Cherry tomatoes, along with chopped sun-dried tomatoes, are pre-baked in baking cups with butter and sugar until reduced and flavorful. These are then topped with puff pastry rounds and baked until golden, before being inverted for serving.
