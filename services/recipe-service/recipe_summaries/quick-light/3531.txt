Papadzules is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of corn tortillas filled with chopped hard-cooked eggs. The tortillas are dipped in a unique, vibrant green sauce made from gently toasted and ground pumpkin seeds, from which a dark green oil is extracted. The remaining seed paste is then blended with an epazote-infused broth to form the sauce. After assembly, the rolled Papadzules are topped with more of the pumpkin seed sauce, salsa, additional chopped egg, and a final drizzle of the extracted pumpkin seed oil for a distinct flavor and presentation.
