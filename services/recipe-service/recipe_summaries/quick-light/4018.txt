A pan-roasted halibut dish served with tender, herbed corona beans. The halibut is brined for optimal texture before being seared to a golden crust and basted with butter. The large white beans are simmered until soft, then tossed with a bright, savory dressing of anchovies, garlic, parsley, capers, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
