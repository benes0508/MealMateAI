A rich pasta dish featuring tagliatelle or fettuccine with sautÃ©ed prosciutto. The creamy sauce is made with butter, orange juice, orange zest, and heavy cream, deglazed with reserved pasta water. The pasta finishes cooking directly in the sauce, and it's served with freshly grated Parmesan and black pepper.
