This recipe details how to make a **Roasted Poblano and Caper Salsa**. It involves broiling a poblano chile until blackened, then peeling and chopping it. Separately, capers and cumin seeds are cooked in olive oil until fragrant and crisp. The chopped poblano is then combined with the caper mixture, thinly sliced lemon (peeled and deseeded), finely chopped onion, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper to create the salsa.
