This recipe details how to make a **Golden-Brown Omelet** using 3 beaten eggs, butter, salt, and pepper. It emphasizes cooking in a hot, buttered nonstick skillet, pulling up the edges to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath, until the bottom is golden brown and the top is set (1-2 minutes). Optional fillings like caramelized onions, herbs, or Parmesan can be added before folding and serving.
