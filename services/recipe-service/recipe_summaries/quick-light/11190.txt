This recipe is for Almond-Milk Granita (Granita di Mandorle), a refreshing Italian frozen dessert. It's made by blending almond paste, sugar, and water, straining the mixture, and then freezing it while periodically stirring and scraping to achieve a light, icy texture. It's often served with warm brioche or espresso.
