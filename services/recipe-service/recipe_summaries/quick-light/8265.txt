This recipe for Deborah Madison's Roasted Squash, Pear, and Ginger Soup features winter squash, ripe pears, and fresh ginger roasted until tender and caramelized. Onions are sautéed, and a flavorful stock is made from the squash scraps. The roasted ingredients, sautéed onions, and stock are simmered together, then pureed until smooth and passed through a food mill for a silky texture. Crème fraîche or sour cream can be swirled in for serving.
