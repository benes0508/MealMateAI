Spring Bibimbap is a fresh take on the classic Korean rice bowl, featuring wilted Swiss chard leaves and quick-pickled chard stems, cucumber, carrots, and radishes. It's served over cooked rice (optionally crisped in a skillet), topped with kimchi, sliced avocado, and toasted nori, with gochujang or sriracha for serving.
