This recipe details how to make a **Pine Nut and White Bean Dip**. Pine nuts are toasted in oil (which is then infused with garlic), blended with cannellini beans, salt, pepper, and water, with the garlic oil gradually added to create a smooth dip. It's garnished with remaining toasted pine nuts and can be prepared up to two days in advance.
