This recipe is for **Chicken Liver Skewers**. Chicken livers are soaked in milk, seasoned, and then threaded onto rosemary sprigs. They are pan-fried in butter and olive oil until golden and cooked through. The dish is finished with a sauce made from butter, radishes, and lemon juice spooned over the cooked skewers.
