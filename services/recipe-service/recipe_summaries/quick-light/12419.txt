This recipe details how to make a **Puffy Corn Omelet**, a light and airy baked egg dish. It involves preparing fresh corn kernels and their "milk," melting butter, then separating and whisking egg yolks and whites. The corn mixture is gently folded into the beaten eggs, which are then spooned into an ovenproof skillet and **baked at 350Â°F for 10-12 minutes** until pale golden and set. The omelet is served sprinkled with fresh chives.
