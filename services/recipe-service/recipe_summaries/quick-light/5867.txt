This recipe is for "Tuckers," unique pyramid-shaped coconut cookies. They are made by cooking unsweetened shredded coconut, egg whites, and sugar until dry, then chilling the dough (optionally with vanilla, rose extract, and red food coloring) for at least 5 hours. The dough is then shaped into 3-sided pyramids, coated in white sanding sugar, and baked until lightly golden.
