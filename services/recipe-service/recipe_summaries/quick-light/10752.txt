This recipe describes how to prepare "Mahimahi with Charred Onion, Tomatoes, and Tapenade Vinaigrette." Mahimahi fillets are seasoned and broiled alongside red onion wedges and cherry tomatoes until the fish is cooked and vegetables are charred. A quick vinaigrette is made from red wine vinegar, tapenade, and olive oil. The dish is served over couscous, with pan juices stirred into the vinaigrette and drizzled on top.
