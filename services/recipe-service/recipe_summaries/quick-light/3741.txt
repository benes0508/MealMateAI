This recipe details how to prepare and grill two 1.5-pound live lobsters. The lobsters are chilled, then bisected lengthwise, seasoned with oil, salt, and pepper. They are grilled cut-side down for 6-8 minutes, then flipped and grilled shell-side up for about 3 minutes until fully cooked. Serve immediately with melted butter, hot sauce, and lemon wedges.
