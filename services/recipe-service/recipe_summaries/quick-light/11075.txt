This Provençal Chicken Stew recipe involves browning flour-coated chicken before slow-cooking it with a sauce made from sautéed onions, garlic, white wine, and crushed tomatoes. The dish is cooked on low for 3-8 hours until the chicken is tender, and then garnished with fresh parsley, basil, and olives before serving.
