This recipe features charred Romanesco (or cauliflower) combined with a rich soffritto of onion, carrot, celery, and chiles. Anchovies and white wine add savory depth, with fresh mint providing a bright finish. The Romanesco is initially browned in a skillet, then roasted with the soffritto, anchovies, and wine until tender.
