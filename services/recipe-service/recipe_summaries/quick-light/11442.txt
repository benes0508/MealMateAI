This recipe prepares gnocchi with browned butternut squash and sautéed shiitake mushrooms. Butternut squash is diced and cooked with sage until tender and lightly browned. Shiitake mushrooms are quickly sautéed with shallots, thyme, and pepper. Gnocchi is browned and crisped in separate skillets with butter, then combined with the squash, mushrooms, and chives. The dish is finished with a rich brown butter sauce infused with parsley and lemon, and garnished with crispy sage leaves.
