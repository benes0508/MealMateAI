This recipe guides you to make crispy homemade potato chips using thinly sliced Yukon Gold or Idaho potatoes. They are tossed with oil, lightly salted, baked at 400Â°F for 12-15 minutes until golden, and then seasoned again with salt and pepper (or optional spices like ancho chile powder, herbs, or nori) while still warm, before cooling on a rack.
