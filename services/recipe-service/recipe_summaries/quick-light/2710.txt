This recipe details how to prepare Country-Style Pork Ribs with a Bourbon and Coke BBQ Sauce in a slow cooker. Pork ribs are first browned, then cooked for 8-9 hours on low with a sauce made from ketchup, cola, tomato paste, garlic, brown sugar, chili sauce, bourbon, cider vinegar, sorghum syrup, Worcestershire, chili powder, and cayenne, until fall-off-the-bone tender. The leftover sauce is then reduced and served over the ribs.
