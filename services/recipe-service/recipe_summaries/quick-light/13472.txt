This recipe details how to make a rich Chicken Liver Pâté with Figs and Walnuts. Chicken livers and onions are simmered in broth, then pureed with butter, Cognac, and salt to form a smooth pâté. After chilling until firm, the pâté is unmolded, pressed with toasted walnuts, and garnished with softened figs and chives. It's served chilled with red leaf lettuce and toasted baguette slices.
