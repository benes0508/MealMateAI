This recipe features pan-seared bone-in pork chops served with roasted carrots and toasted buckwheat. The carrots are roasted with garlic and finished with fresh orange segments and lime juice. Pearled buckwheat is boiled until tender, then crisped in a skillet with butter. The sliced pork, seasoned carrots, and dill-tossed buckwheat are arranged together and garnished with a drizzle of lime juice, olive oil, and Aleppo pepper.
