Enchiladas Divorciadas is a Mexican dish featuring corn tortillas filled with seasoned shredded chicken. It's served "divorced" (separated) with two distinct homemade sauces: a vibrant Salsa Verde made with tomatillos, serrano chiles, and cilantro, and a rich Salsa Roja crafted from guajillo and chile de árbol peppers with tomatoes. The chicken is gently poached and shredded, and the tortillas are briefly softened in oil before being filled and rolled. The enchiladas are then plated with each sauce on opposite sides, topped with a blend of crème fraîche and queso fresco, and garnished with fresh onion.
