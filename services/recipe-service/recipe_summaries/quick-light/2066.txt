This Garlic Mojo Sauce is a zesty, bright condiment featuring prominent garlic flavor balanced by fresh lime and orange juices, cumin, oregano, and a hint of Fresno chile. It's quickly prepared by lightly saut√©ing aromatics before mixing with fresh ingredients, and can be made up to a week in advance.
