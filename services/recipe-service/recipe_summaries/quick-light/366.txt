This recipe details how to make Broiled Goat Cheese Toasts with Marinated Greens. Baguette slices are broiled until golden, then topped with soft goat cheese and briefly re-broiled. These warm toasts are served with wilted leafy greens (such as Swiss chard or kale) marinated in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and lemon juice, and garnished with lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
