This recipe provides detailed instructions for making **homemade egg pasta dough (Pasta All'uovo)** from scratch using **all-purpose or 'farina 00' flour and eggs**. It outlines **two methods: a traditional hand-kneading approach** starting with a flour "fountain," and a **quicker food processor method**. A strong emphasis is placed on **vigorous, extended kneading (15-30 minutes)** to achieve a **smooth, elastic, and non-sticky dough**. The finished dough is then **rested for 30 minutes** to develop gluten before being rolled or shaped into various pasta forms.
