Stuffing Fried Rice is a unique fried rice dish that combines crispy, egg-infused short-grain white rice with golden-brown stuffing cubes, saut√©ed Tuscan kale, and honshimeji or oyster mushrooms. It's seasoned with chives, ground coriander, and mushroom soy sauce, and cooked in a skillet for a flavorful, texturally varied meal.
