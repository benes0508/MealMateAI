This recipe features **Oven-Roasted Dungeness Crab**, prepared by roasting large Dungeness crabs in an ovenproof skillet at high heat. The crabs are cooked with a rich blend of butter, olive oil, minced garlic, shallot, and a touch of crushed red pepper. A bright, reduced blood orange (or regular orange) juice and peel sauce is then spooned over the finished crabs, which are garnished with fresh thyme and parsley.
