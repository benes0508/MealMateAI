**Rainbow Chard and Radicchio Sauté**

This recipe describes how to prepare a vibrant vegetable sauté featuring rainbow chard and radicchio. It involves sautéing onion and garlic, then cooking chard ribs, followed by chard leaves and radicchio until tender and wilted. The dish is finished with red wine vinegar, optional currants, and toasted pine nuts, resulting in a savory and slightly bitter-sweet side or light main.

**Likely Collection:** `quick-light` (due to sautéing/wilting), `plant-based` (if prepared without butter, or if butter is substituted).
