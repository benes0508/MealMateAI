"Baked Crottins with Sauteed Mushrooms" is a sophisticated salad featuring baked goat cheese rounds (crottins) and a warm, savory mushroom mixture. Mixed mushrooms are sautéed until tender, while a complementary vinaigrette is prepared from cooked leeks, celery, and carrots, simmered with chicken stock and sherry vinegar. The crottins are baked with a portion of this vinaigrette, then served atop mixed salad greens tossed with the remaining vinaigrette and the sautéed mushrooms, optionally with toasted country bread.
