This recipe describes how to grill Citrus-Stuffed Branzini. Whole branzini are seasoned with salt and olive oil, then stuffed with lemon and orange slices and fresh basil. They are grilled until cooked through, then drizzled with a fresh lemon and orange juice-infused olive oil mixture for a bright, citrusy finish.
