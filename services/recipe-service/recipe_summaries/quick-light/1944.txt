Saltie's Soft-Scrambled Eggs is a simple recipe for tender, creamy eggs. The distinctive method involves cooking egg whites first in a nonstick skillet, then removing from heat and gently folding in the yolks to finish cooking with residual heat. This technique results in a soft texture, described as similar to 'scrambling an over easy egg.' It requires only eggs, butter, salt, and optional herbs.
