A recipe for pickled vegetables, featuring beets, baby carrots, celery, and cauliflower. Each vegetable is uniquely spiced – caraway for carrots, coriander for celery, and shichimi togarashi for cauliflower, while beets remain plain – before being hot-brined in a solution of water, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. The vegetables are chilled separately for at least one week to develop their flavors.
