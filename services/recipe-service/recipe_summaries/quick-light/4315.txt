This recipe prepares Roasted White Chocolate Panna Cotta, a creamy dessert. White chocolate is roasted until nutty brown, then combined with a base of milk, heavy cream, and gelatin. The mixture is chilled for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, and can be unmolded by briefly dipping the ramekin in hot water before serving.
