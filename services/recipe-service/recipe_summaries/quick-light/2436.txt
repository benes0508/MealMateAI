The Smoked Salmon 7-Layer Dip is a chilled, savory appetizer featuring layers of flaked hot smoked salmon and a creamy blend of cream cheese, goat cheese, beet horseradish, and lemon zest. Additional layers include finely chopped radishes, red onion, and capers. Assembled in a mold and chilled to set, it's garnished with chives and served with Belgian endive leaves and bagel chips.
