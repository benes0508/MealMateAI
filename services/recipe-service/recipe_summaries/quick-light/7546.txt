This recipe for Roasted Veal Shanks with Rosemary involves searing large veal shanks until deeply browned, then roasting them uncovered. Concurrently, a mirepoix of carrots, onion, and celery is saut√©ed with fresh rosemary, sage, and garlic. The veal is then braised with these vegetables, white wine, and chicken broth in the oven until very tender. A rich sauce is made by pureeing some of the braising vegetables with the strained pan juices, which is then served over the sliced veal.
