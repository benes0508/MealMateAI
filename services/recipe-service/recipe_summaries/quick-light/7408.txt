This recipe details how to prepare Stir-Fried Bok Choy and Mizuna with Tofu. It involves whisking a sauce from soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar. Extra-firm tofu is sliced, drained, pan-fried until golden, then brushed with some of the sauce. In the same skillet, green onions, ginger, and garlic are stir-fried, followed by the remaining sauce, bok choy, and mizuna, until wilted. Finally, the cooked tofu is added back and gently tossed with the greens before serving.
