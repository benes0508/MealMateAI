This recipe for Olive Oil-Baked Beet Chips uses thinly sliced beets, olive oil, sea salt, and black pepper. The beets are sliced very thin (1/16" with a mandoline), tossed with olive oil, and baked at 350Â°F for 25-30 minutes until crisp. After baking and cooling, the chips are blotted to remove excess oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.
