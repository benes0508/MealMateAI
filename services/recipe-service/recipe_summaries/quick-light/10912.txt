This recipe details an Israeli Couscous Risotto featuring butternut squash, radicchio, and a vibrant parsley lemon butter. The couscous is cooked risotto-style with onion, lemon peel, chicken broth, and squash until tender, then mixed with radicchio and Parmesan. A separate parsley butter (parsley, butter, lemon peel) is prepared and swirled into the finished dish before serving.
