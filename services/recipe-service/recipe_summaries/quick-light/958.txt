This recipe details how to make homemade "Stars Pappardelle," a two-toned pasta featuring an embedded star pattern. It involves rolling two different colored doughs, cutting stars from one sheet, precisely layering the second sheet over the first, and then carefully re-rolling and cutting the combined dough to create patterned, wide pasta noodles (pappardelle). The process emphasizes specific rolling techniques to achieve symmetrical stars. The final pasta is boiled for 2 minutes.
