This recipe details how to make **Meyer Lemon Semifreddo with Summer Berries**, a refreshing no-churn frozen dessert. It involves whisking a bright lemon-infused egg yolk and sugar custard over simmering water, then beating it until cool and voluminous. This is then folded with whipped cream, poured into an almond-lined loaf pan, and frozen until firm. The semifreddo is served sliced, accompanied by a mix of lightly sweetened fresh summer berries.
