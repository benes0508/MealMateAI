These no-bake Chocolate, Pistachio, and Tahini Truffles combine melted bittersweet chocolate, tahini, honey, cinnamon, and orange zest, which is then chilled until firm. The firm mixture is scooped, rolled into balls, and coated in a crunchy blend of chopped pistachios and toasted white sesame seeds. They can be prepared up to 5 days in advance and require chilling before serving.
