This recipe for Broiled Tofu with Miso (Tofu Dengaku) involves firming up tofu by microwaving it, then cutting it into squares. A sweet and savory glaze is made from red miso, sugar, and sake. The tofu squares are first broiled to form a crust, then topped with the miso glaze and broiled again until bubbling and lightly colored. Finally, they are garnished with toasted sesame seeds and served on picks.
