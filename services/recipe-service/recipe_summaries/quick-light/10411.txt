This recipe for Chinese Barbecued Baby Back Ribs features baby back ribs coated in a savory-sweet sauce made from ginger, garlic, soy sauce, hoisin, and honey. The ribs are first baked at 400Â°F for about 40 minutes, basted during cooking, and then finished under the broiler to achieve a delicious, lightly charred exterior.
