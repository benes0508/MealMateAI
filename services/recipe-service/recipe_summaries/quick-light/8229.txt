This recipe is for a Tuscan Bean Soup, featuring a creamy base made from pureed white beans (cannellini, borlotti, or giant white beans) cooked with garlic, thyme, and basil. The soup is then enriched with whole beans and shredded Napa cabbage, simmered until tender. It's served topped with drizzles of high-quality olive oil, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and torn prosciutto.
