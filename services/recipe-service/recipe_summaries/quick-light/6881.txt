This recipe details how to make a **Summer Berry Pudding**, a no-bake dessert featuring a layered construction of brioche or challah bread and a mixed berry sauce (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries) infused with vanilla. The pudding is assembled in a springform pan, pressed to compact, and chilled, resulting in a soaked, fruit-dense dessert.
