This recipe is for a baked spiced seed sprinkle, combining pumpkin and black sesame seeds with a mix of sugar, kosher salt, cayenne pepper, and ground cardamom. The seeds are coated with a frothy egg white, then baked until toasted and dry, making a versatile topping that can be stored for up to a week.
