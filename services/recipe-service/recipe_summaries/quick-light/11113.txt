This recipe details preparing a **Stuffed Rack of Venison**. A savory-sweet stuffing is made from **sautéed Italian sausage and onion, mixed with roasted Bosc pears, toasted pecans, dried currants, and fresh rosemary**. A cavity is created in the venison rack, filled with the stuffing, then the venison is seared until browned. It's then roasted atop a bed of sliced onions, garlic, and herbs (rosemary, thyme) until it reaches 120°F for rare (about 20 minutes), followed by a 10-minute rest before carving and serving.
