This recipe is for "My Hero," a sandwich featuring French or Italian bread brushed with olive oil, layered with mozzarella, fresh basil, prosciutto, and Genoa salami. It's topped with a simple salad of arugula and tomato strips tossed in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper. The sandwich is then cut diagonally and ready for transport.
