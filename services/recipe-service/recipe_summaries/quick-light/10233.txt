This recipe details how to prepare Brandied-Peach Pork Chops. It involves pan-frying thick-cut pork chops until golden, then deglazing the same skillet to create a rich sauce using sautéed shallots and thyme, brandy (flambéed), thawed frozen peaches, and peach preserves. The sauce is then spooned over the cooked chops.
