**Grilled Herbed Poussins:** Poussins (or small Cornish hens), split and with backbones removed, are rubbed with a blend of fresh basil, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. They are grilled, starting over direct heat to brown, then finishing over indirect heat until cooked through.
