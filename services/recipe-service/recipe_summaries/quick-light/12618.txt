Chickpea Fritters (Panelle) are traditional Sicilian-style fried fritters made by cooking chickpea flour, water, salt, and olive oil into a thick, polenta-like mixture. This mixture is then chilled until firm in a loaf pan, sliced into thin pieces, and deep-fried until golden and puffed. They are served immediately, typically garnished with fresh parsley and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
