This recipe is for two types of fruit gelee: Cranberry and Tart Apple. Each gelee is prepared separately by simmering fruit (cranberries with Granny Smith apples and orange for one; Granny Smith apples with apple and lemon for the other) with sugar and spices, pureeing, then thickening with pectin until very firm. The apple gelee also gets green food coloring. Both are chilled, then inverted, peeled, cut into 1-inch squares, and rolled in sparkling sugar. They can be made up to a week in advance.
