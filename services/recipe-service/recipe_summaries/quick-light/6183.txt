"Sole en Papillote with Tomatoes and Olives" is a baked fish dish where sole fillets are sealed in parchment paper packets with a sautéed mixture of garlic, red pepper flakes, grape tomatoes, capers, and Kalamata olives, seasoned with white wine, butter, and fresh thyme. The packets are roasted at 450°F and served with garlic-rubbed toasted ciabatta bread.
