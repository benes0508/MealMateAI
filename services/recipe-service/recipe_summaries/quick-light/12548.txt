This Pasta Cacio e Pepe recipe features pasta (penne/bucatini), pecorino romano cheese, black pepper, and olive oil, with the unique addition of fresh arugula. Cooked pasta is tossed immediately with oil, arugula, and cheese, using reserved pasta water to achieve a creamy consistency, then seasoned and served.
