This Spinach Lasagna recipe features layers of whole wheat noodles, a savory slow-cooked onion and garlic mixture, seasoned spinach, a creamy part-skim ricotta and lemon zest blend, a rich stock-based roux, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is assembled by layering the cooked components in a pan, then baked until golden brown before being rested and served.
