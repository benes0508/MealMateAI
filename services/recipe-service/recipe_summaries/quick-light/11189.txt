**Spaghetti with Olive and Pine Nut Salsa** is a quick and simple pasta dish featuring spaghetti tossed with a no-cook "salsa." The "salsa" is made by very finely chopping Gaeta olives, capers, and pine nuts, then combining them with fresh flat-leaf parsley, red pepper flakes, and extra virgin olive oil. The cooked spaghetti is then mixed directly with this flavorful olive mixture.
