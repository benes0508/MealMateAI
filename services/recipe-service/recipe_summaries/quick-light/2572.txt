This recipe details how to make a vibrant Roasted Red Pepper Harissa. It involves cooking garlic in olive oil, toasting and grinding whole spices (caraway, coriander, cumin, black peppercorns), then blending these with jarred roasted red peppers, fresh chile, red wine vinegar, sugar, and salt until smooth. The harissa can be prepared a day ahead.
