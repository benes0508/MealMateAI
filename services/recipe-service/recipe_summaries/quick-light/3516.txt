This recipe details how to make a **Black Grape Compote** by simmering seedless black grapes with sugar, fresh lemon juice, and star anise for 8-10 minutes until syrupy. The star anise is removed, and a touch of butter is whisked in before cooling. It yields a sweet, tart, and aromatic fruit topping or sauce.
