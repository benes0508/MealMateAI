This recipe features cod gently poached in milk infused with aromatic lemongrass, garlic, and thyme. It's served over creamy mashed potatoes, which are also enriched with the infused milk. A vibrant relish made from preserved lemon, fresh chives, lemon juice, and hot smoked paprika is spooned over the fish, adding a bright, tangy, and subtly smoky counterpoint to the delicate cod and potatoes.
