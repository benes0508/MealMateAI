This Salsa Verde recipe features grilled tomatillos, garlic, onion, and serrano or jalape√±o chiles. These charred vegetables are then blended with fresh cilantro and a touch of sugar. The mixture is simmered with chicken broth and lime juice until thickened, yielding about 2 1/2 cups of flavorful salsa. It can be prepared a day ahead.
