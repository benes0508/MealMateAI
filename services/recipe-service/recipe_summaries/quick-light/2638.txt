This recipe details how to make Marinated Manchego with Orange Preserve, an elegant appetizer. It involves roasting garlic and preparing a homemade orange preserve from blanched orange peels simmered with sugar and juice. These components are then combined with Manchego cheese, fresh rosemary, thyme, and olive oil. The mixture is chilled for at least 12 hours to allow the flavors to meld, resulting in a savory-sweet, aromatic dish best served at room temperature with crusty bread. It can be made up to 5 days ahead.
