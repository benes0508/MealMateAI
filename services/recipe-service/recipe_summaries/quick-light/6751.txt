This recipe features green beans blanched until crisp-tender and cooled. They are then tossed with a savory and tangy miso dressing made from white miso, rice vinegar, Japanese hot mustard, vegetable oil, sugar, and scallions. Finally, the dish is garnished with toasted sliced almonds and additional scallions, and can be served warm or at room temperature.
