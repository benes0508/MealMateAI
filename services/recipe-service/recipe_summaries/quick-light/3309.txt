This recipe is for a **Broccoli and Brussels Sprouts Slaw**. It features thinly sliced raw broccoli and Brussels sprouts, tossed with a zesty dressing made from lemon juice, olive oil, grated Parmesan (and optional anchovies), seasoned with salt and pepper. The slaw is finished with Castelvetrano olives, chopped roasted almonds, and shaved Parmesan. It can be made a day ahead, adding almonds just before serving.
