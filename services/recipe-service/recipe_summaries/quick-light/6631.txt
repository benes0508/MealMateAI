Petits Farcis is a classic French dish featuring various hollowed-out vegetables like onions, squashes, tomatoes, eggplants, bell peppers, and zucchini. These are generously stuffed with a savory mixture of ground veal, pork, Parmesan cheese, and aromatics such as onion, garlic, thyme, and fennel seeds. The stuffed vegetables are baked until the meat is cooked and the vegetable caps are crispy, then drizzled with olive oil and served lukewarm.
