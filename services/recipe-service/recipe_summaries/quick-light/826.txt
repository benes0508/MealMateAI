This recipe is for "Black Seed Bread," a dense, seed-based loaf made with a large amount of flaxseed (ground and whole), eggs, olive oil, tahini, black and white sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. The batter is prepared by combining wet ingredients with ground flaxseed and whole seeds, then left to hydrate before baking at a low temperature (200Â°F) for 1.5-2 hours. The bread can be made up to 5 days ahead and stored chilled.
