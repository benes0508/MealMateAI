This recipe details how to make Mushroom, Rajas, and Corn Tacos with Queso Fresco. It involves roasting anaheim and poblano chiles (rajas), blackening corn kernels, and sautéing onions, garlic, and mushrooms. These cooked vegetables are then combined and mixed with queso fresco. The tacos are assembled by spooning the vegetable mixture onto warm corn tortillas, then topping with salsa quemada, grated cotixa or añejo cheese, and a cilantro sprig.
