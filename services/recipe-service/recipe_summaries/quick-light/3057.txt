Pizzarelle are honey-soaked matzo fritters. Matzo is softened in water, then combined with egg yolk, sugar, pine nuts, raisins, and orange zest. Stiff-peaked egg whites are gently folded into the mixture, which is then deep-fried until golden brown. The fritters are served warm, drizzled with honey.
