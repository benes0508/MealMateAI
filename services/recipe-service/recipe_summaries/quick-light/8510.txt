This recipe features seared mahi-mahi fillets served over a vibrant green gazpacho sauce. The sauce is made by blending cucumber, green onions, cilantro, olive oil, white balsamic vinegar, and serrano chiles. The mahi-mahi is seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin, then pan-seared until opaque. The dish is plated with the gazpacho sauce base, topped with the seared fish, and garnished with halved cherry tomatoes.
