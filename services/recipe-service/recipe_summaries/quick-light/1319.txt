This recipe details a Low-Fuss Crispy Roast Chicken with potatoes and onions. A whole chicken is thoroughly dried, seasoned with salt and pepper, and herbed under the skin. It's roasted at 450Â°F in a preheated cast-iron skillet, alongside potatoes and onions tossed with olive oil and herbs. The chicken is cooked until tender and crispy, then rests while the vegetables finish roasting. Juices are reserved for serving. An optional dry brine is suggested for even crispier skin.
