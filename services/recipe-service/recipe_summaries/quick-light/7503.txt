This recipe details how to prepare a Potato Gratin with Mushrooms and Gruyère. It involves first sautéing a mixture of leeks, mushrooms, and garlic. Separately, thinly sliced Yukon Gold potatoes are simmered in heavy cream until partially cooked and the cream reduces. These components are then layered in a baking dish, with the mushroom mixture sandwiched between two layers of potatoes, topped with Gruyère cheese. The gratin is baked until tender and golden brown, then rested before serving.
