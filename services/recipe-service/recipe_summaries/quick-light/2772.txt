This recipe details how to prepare a 3-ingredient Thanksgiving Turkey (with orange and sage) by spatchcocking (removing backbone and flattening), seasoning with an orange zest-sage-salt-pepper rub under the skin and in the cavity, and chilling for 6-18 hours. The turkey is then roasted with orange slices and sage sprigs tucked underneath, starting at 450°F for 30 minutes, then reducing to 350°F for 55-65 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 160°F. After roasting, it rests for 30 minutes before carving.
