This recipe describes how to make "Raspberries with Saba Sabayon." It involves whisking egg yolks, powdered sugar, saba (an unfermented grape syrup), and water in a double boiler until thickened and then cooling it over ice. Whipped cream is folded in, and the sabayon is chilled. To serve, fresh raspberries are topped with the chilled sabayon.
