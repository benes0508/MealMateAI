This recipe is for **Cheesy Stuffed Tomatoes**. Large heirloom tomatoes are hollowed out, seasoned, and filled with a mixture of toasted pistachios, garlic, golden raisins, olive oil, and thyme. Fresh mozzarella pieces are nestled in, and the tomatoes are topped with their reserved caps. They are then baked at 325Â°F for 35-45 minutes until tender and slightly wrinkled.
