Pork Chops au Poivre features pan-seared, bone-in pork chops coated in coarsely crushed black peppercorns and salt. They are cooked until browned and just done. A pan sauce is then made by deglazing with dry sherry, reducing it, and adding heavy cream and meat juices until slightly thickened. The sauce is served over the chops.
