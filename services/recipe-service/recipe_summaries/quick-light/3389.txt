This recipe details how to make **Salmon with Caper-Anchovy Butter**. It involves blending garlic, anchovies, capers, lemon juice, cognac, and parsley with room-temperature butter to form a flavored butter log, which is then frozen. Salmon fillets are seasoned, broiled for about 8 minutes until cooked through, and then topped with slices of the prepared caper-anchovy butter before serving. The butter can be made up to a week in advance.
