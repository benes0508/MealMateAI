Vermicelli with Sauce alla Sofia is a quick and simple pasta dish featuring a savory and briny sauce. The sauce is prepared by finely processing garlic, fresh parsley, onion, anchovy fillets, green olives, and capers, then blending with olive oil. It's tossed with cooked vermicelli (or similar thin pasta) and served immediately.
