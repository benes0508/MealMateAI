This recipe details a grilled chicken dish infused with garlic and rosemary. The chicken is initially grilled indirectly over a bed of aromatics (rosemary, garlic, and scallions) to build flavor, then finished directly on the grates for a crispy skin. It's served with additional tender, charred grilled scallions.
