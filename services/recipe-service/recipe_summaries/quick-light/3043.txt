A simple, flavorful vegetarian dish featuring cannellini beans slow-simmered with garlic, sage, and olive oil until creamy. Fresh spinach is quickly saut√©ed with garlic and red pepper flakes, then combined with the cooked beans and brightened with lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, and a touch of the bean cooking liquid for a saucy finish. Beans can be cooked ahead of time.
