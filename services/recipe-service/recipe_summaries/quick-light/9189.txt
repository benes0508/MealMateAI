This recipe details how to prepare "Farfalle with Golden Beets, Beet Greens and Pine Nuts." It involves toasting pine nuts, sautÃ©ing onions until caramelized, then adding garlic and beet greens until tender. Golden beets are boiled separately until tender, and farfalle pasta is cooked in the same beet cooking liquid. Finally, the cooked pasta, beets, and onion-greens mixture are combined, moistened with reserved pasta water, seasoned, and tossed with Parmesan cheese, then served topped with toasted pine nuts.
