This recipe details how to make homemade Bratwurst Bites. It involves finely grinding partially frozen pork spareribs and fat, mixing with sage, salt, mace, pepper, coriander, and sugar, then chilling overnight with a small amount of lager beer. The mixture is formed into small patties, browned in a skillet, then simmered with more lager until cooked through. Serve with Beer and Horseradish Mustard and soft pretzels or rye bread.
