Green Olive and Almond Tapenade is a savory spread or dip made by blending pitted green olives, toasted slivered almonds, fresh parsley, and lemon juice in a food processor until finely chopped. Olive oil is then added to form a smooth paste. It is typically served with carrot sticks, pita wedges, or toasted baguette slices.
