This recipe for Gluten-Free Focaccia Bread features mashed Yukon gold potato, a blend of tapioca, sorghum, potato, and sweet rice flours, along with xanthan and guar gums for structure. Flavored with fresh rosemary, the dough is lightened by folded-in stiff egg whites, giving it a thick cake batter consistency. It undergoes a single rise and is baked in a pie pan, with ice cubes placed in the oven to create steam for a perfect crust.
