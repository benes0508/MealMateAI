Ludo's Omelet is a sophisticated recipe focused on achieving a smooth, crème brûlée-like texture. It utilizes very fresh eggs, thoroughly whisked and optionally strained, cooked gently in a nonstick skillet with high-quality unsalted European-style butter. The eggs are continuously stirred until just set underneath but still runny on top, then filled with Boursin pepper cheese. The omelet is carefully rolled, finished with a touch more butter for sheen, and garnished with fleur de sel and fresh chives.
