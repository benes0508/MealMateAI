Biltong is a traditional South African dried meat snack made from lean cuts of venison, beef, or ostrich. The meat is cut into strips, seasoned with a mix of crushed roasted coriander, salt, and black pepper, then refrigerated for a day. Finally, it's hung to air dry for approximately 5 days until it reaches the desired crispness or moisture.
