Annie Lau's Garlic Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts is a quick and simple side dish featuring Brussels sprouts and minced garlic. The recipe emphasizes high-heat stir-frying to achieve a desirable caramelization and browning on the sprouts for enhanced flavor, while carefully avoiding overcooking to prevent a sulfurous taste.
