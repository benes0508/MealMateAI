Sponge Candy is a classic aerated candy made from a hot sugar syrup (sugar, corn syrup, vinegar) cooked to 300Â°F. Baking soda is then stirred in, causing the mixture to foam vigorously and create its characteristic brittle, porous texture. It's poured, cooled until solid, and then broken into pieces. It can be stored airtight for up to a week.
