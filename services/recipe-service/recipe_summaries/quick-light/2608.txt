A refreshing Coconut-Vegetable Slaw made with blanched mung bean sprouts, snow peas, carrots, and purple cabbage. It's dressed in a spicy-sweet pur√©e of Thai chiles, garlic, ginger, and brown sugar, complemented by kaffir lime leaves and fresh or shredded coconut. The cabbage is added just before serving to maintain its crispness and color.
