This Gazpacho recipe emphasizes a smooth, creamy texture by blanching garlic multiple times and straining the blended vegetables. Key ingredients include tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumber, onion, and garlic, with bread, water, olive oil, sherry vinegar, and a touch of mayonnaise added for richness. The soup is served chilled, garnished with croutons and an olive oil drizzle.
