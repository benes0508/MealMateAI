This recipe details how to prepare "Bratwurst in Beer" by first saut√©ing onions and optional garlic in butter with beer in a foil pan on the grill. Bratwurst links are then grilled until charred, transferred to the beer-onion mixture to warm, and finally served in hoagie rolls with the onions, whole grain mustard, and dill pickle spears.
