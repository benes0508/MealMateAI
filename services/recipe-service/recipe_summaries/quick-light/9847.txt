This recipe details how to make Mixed-Berry Jam using raspberries, blackberries, sugar, and lemon juice. The process involves combining ingredients and letting them stand, then cooking the fruit mixture until it reaches a thick, gelling consistency. The jam is then hot-packed into sterilized jars and processed in a boiling water bath to ensure proper sealing for storage.
