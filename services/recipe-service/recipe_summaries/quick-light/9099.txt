A recipe for pan-fried Potato-Wrapped Halibut with Sautéed Spinach. Halibut fillets are seasoned, then wrapped in very thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes and pan-fried in olive oil until golden and the fish is opaque. Fresh baby spinach is quickly sautéed with garlic in the same skillet until wilted, to be served alongside the halibut.
