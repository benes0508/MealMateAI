"Halva 5 Ways" is a recipe for traditional Middle Eastern sesame candy. The base halva is prepared by cooking a sugar syrup to 250Â°F, then gradually streaming it into a tahini, salt, and vanilla mixture until it forms a smooth mass. This is pressed into a pan, cooled, and chilled. The recipe includes five distinct variations: Pistachio-Rosewater, Cardamom-Dark Chocolate, Poppy Seed-Lemon Zest, and Za'atar. Halva can be made up to 3 weeks ahead and stored chilled in an airtight container.
