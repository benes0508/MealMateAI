Grilled corn on the cob is prepared by grilling until tender and charred, then generously coated with a savory herb butter. The butter is made from unsalted butter, fresh herbs (such as cilantro, chives, and parsley), salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne. The herb butter can be made a day in advance.
