Green Posole with Chicken is a savory, quick-to-prepare Mexican-inspired stew. It features shredded rotisserie chicken, white hominy, and a vibrant green salsa base, simmered in chicken broth. The use of pre-cooked chicken makes it a convenient option. It's typically served hot with a variety of fresh garnishes like avocado, radishes, cucumbers, and tortilla chips.
