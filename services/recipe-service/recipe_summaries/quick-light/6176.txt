This recipe prepares **Herbes de Provence Rotisserie Chickens**, featuring a flavorful butter paste seasoned with herbes de Provence and salt rubbed under the skin and on the outside of two 3 1/2-pound chickens. The chickens are trussed, then require a minimum 6-hour chill (up to 1 day ahead). They are cooked on a rotisserie grill at around 400°F until an internal thigh temperature of 170°F is reached, followed by a resting period before serving.
