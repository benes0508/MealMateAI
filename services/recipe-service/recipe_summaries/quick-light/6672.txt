This recipe details how to make **Triple-Cooked Chips** using Maris Piper potatoes. The process involves three main stages: first, boiling the potatoes until nearly falling apart; second, an initial fry at 130°C to form a light crust; and third, a final fry at 180°C until golden. Key steps include washing starch off, drying/freezing between cooks to remove moisture, and finishing with sea salt.
