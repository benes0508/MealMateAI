This recipe details how to prepare a **Roast Beef with Dijon-Caper Sauce**. An eye of round beef roast is seasoned with salt, thyme, basil, and pepper, then browned on the stovetop before being oven-roasted to a medium-rare temperature. A pan sauce is then made from the beef juices, butter, flour, beef broth, Dijon mustard, and capers. The cooked beef is sliced very thinly and served with the savory sauce.
