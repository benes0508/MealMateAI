Salsa Verde: A fresh, savory, and pungent green sauce. It's made by creating a chunky paste from optional anchovies, garlic, capers, and a fresno chile, then stirring in finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, mint, and cilantro. Extra virgin olive oil is then slowly whisked in to form the sauce. Best made 30 minutes ahead for flavors to meld, and can be stored for up to a week.
