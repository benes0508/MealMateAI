This recipe details how to prepare **Boiled Yuca (Yuca Hervida)**, a simple side dish. Fresh or frozen yuca is boiled with salt until tender, with variations for "Paraguayan style" (fork-tender, ~25 mins) or "Cuban style" (very tender, 30-40 mins). After draining and removing internal spindles, it's served hot, optionally with a table sauce.
