A rich Cr√®me Anglaise (custard sauce) flavored with Drambuie liqueur. It's prepared by tempering egg yolks and sugar with a hot mixture of heavy cream, sour cream, and vanilla bean, then gently cooking until thickened. The sauce is strained, chilled over an ice bath, and finished by stirring in the Drambuie before refrigerating.
