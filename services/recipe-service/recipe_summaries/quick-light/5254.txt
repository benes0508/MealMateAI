This recipe details how to make **Preserved Lemons**. It involves boiling lemons until soft, scoring them, then brining them in a mixture of the reserved cooking liquid, sugar, kosher salt, crushed coriander seeds, ground turmeric, and a clove. The lemons are then chilled in the brine for at least two weeks to preserve them.
