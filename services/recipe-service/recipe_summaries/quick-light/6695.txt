Pat's Deep-Fried Cornish Game Hens is a recipe for preparing crispy, flavorful Cornish game hens. The hens are marinated for 8 hours or overnight in a buttermilk mixture seasoned with kosher salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, poultry seasoning, cayenne, and lemon pepper, along with onion and fresh thyme. After marinating, they are dredged in seasoned all-purpose flour and deep-fried in peanut oil at 375°F for 13 minutes until golden brown, then held warm in a 200°F oven. An alternative method for baking the hens is also provided.
