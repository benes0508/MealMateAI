This recipe details how to make Soft Polenta with Mushrooms and Spinach. Instant polenta is cooked with Parmesan, salt, and pepper until soft. Separately, mushrooms are saut√©ed with garlic, and baby spinach is stir-fried until wilted. An egg is fried. To serve, buttered polenta is topped with the mushrooms, spinach, and fried egg, then garnished with additional Parmesan. Note that half the polenta can be saved for later.
