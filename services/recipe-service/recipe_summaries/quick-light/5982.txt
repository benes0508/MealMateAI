This recipe details how to prepare a **Simple Roast Turkey**. It involves seasoning a 12-14 pound turkey with salt and pepper, stuffing the cavity with onion and celery, and rubbing it with butter. The turkey is initially roasted at 450°F for 30 minutes, then the temperature is reduced to 325°F. A glaze made from butter, soy sauce, mirin (or teriyaki), and rosemary is applied during the remainder of the roasting process, which includes frequent basting, until the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (totaling about 2 hours 45 minutes). The turkey is then rested for one hour before carving.
