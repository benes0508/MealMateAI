This recipe is for a **Porcini-Rubbed Beef Rib Roast**. It involves slow-roasting a bone-in beef rib roast that's been generously seasoned with a homemade rub of ground dried porcini mushrooms, salt, peppercorns, and marjoram/oregano. The cooking method uses a two-stage approach: a long slow roast at 225°F (approx. 4 hours) followed by a short blast at 500°F to brown and crisp the exterior, resulting in a medium-rare finish. It's served sliced, optionally with flaky sea salt and Horseradish-Yogurt Sauce.
