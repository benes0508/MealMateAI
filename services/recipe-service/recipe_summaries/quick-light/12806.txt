Pumpkin Seed Brittle is a candy made from sugar and pumpkin seeds. The process involves boiling sugar, water, and salt to a soft-ball stage, then stirring in pumpkin seeds until the sugar crystallizes. The mixture is then returned to heat, stirring until the sugar melts into a deep caramel, toasting the seeds. Finally, it's poured onto parchment, rolled thin, and cut.
