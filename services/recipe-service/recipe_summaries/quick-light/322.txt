This recipe for Crispy Tofu Balls involves pressing and mashing firm tofu, then mixing it with scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and white pepper. The mixture is formed into balls, coated in a flour paste, and then rolled in a unique blend of green glutinous rice flakes and cornstarch. Finally, the balls are deep-fried until golden and crispy, and served with spicy aioli for dipping.
