This recipe features a hearty pasta dish with spicy Italian sausage, balanced by the slightly bitter notes of radicchio and the sweet-tangy flavor of sun-dried tomatoes. The sauce is built in a skillet with saut√©ed onions, then tossed with short pasta and a touch of reserved cooking liquid for a cohesive meal.
