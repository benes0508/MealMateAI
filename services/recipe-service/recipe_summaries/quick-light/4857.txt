Shakshuka is a savory Middle Eastern and North African dish featuring eggs gently poached in a flavorful, spiced tomato sauce. The sauce is made by sautéing onions, bell peppers, jalapeño, and garlic, then adding tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and spices like paprika, cumin, and caraway. Swiss chard or spinach is layered in, and then eggs are cracked directly into the simmering sauce and cooked until the whites are set.
