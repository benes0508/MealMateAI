This recipe features rigatoni pasta tossed in a bright, spicy, and rich sauce made from butter, lemon zest and juice, and red pepper flakes, emulsified with pasta cooking liquid and finished with Pecorino cheese. It's uniquely topped with finely grated hard-boiled egg yolks for added richness and texture.
