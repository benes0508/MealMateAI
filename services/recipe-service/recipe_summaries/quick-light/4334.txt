This recipe details how to prepare **Green Beans with Shallots, Hazelnuts, and Tarragon**. Hazelnuts are first toasted and skinned. Shallots are then sautéed until golden. Thin green beans (haricots verts) are cooked in the same pan with butter, water, salt, and pepper until crisp-tender and glazed. Finally, the beans are tossed with fresh tarragon, lemon zest, the toasted hazelnuts, and sautéed shallots, then served immediately.
