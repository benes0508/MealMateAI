"Egg in the Middle" is a simple breakfast or brunch dish featuring an egg cooked directly within a hole cut from a slice of bread. You fry the bread (and the cutout "hats") in olive oil, then crack an egg into the center, cooking until the whites are set and yolks are soft. Ingredients include bread (preferably whole wheat), eggs, and olive oil.
