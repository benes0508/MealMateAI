This recipe details how to prepare a **Poblano, Potato, and Corn Gratin**. Layers of thinly sliced Yukon Gold potatoes, saut√©ed poblano chiles, and corn are arranged in a baking dish with Oaxaca or mozzarella cheese. A creamy mixture of half-and-half, flour, salt, and pepper is poured over, and the gratin is baked covered, then uncovered with additional cheese until the potatoes are tender and the cheese is golden brown.
