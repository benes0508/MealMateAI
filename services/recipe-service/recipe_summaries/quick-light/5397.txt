This recipe details how to make Dandelion Wine. It involves steeping dandelion flowers in boiling water, straining the resulting "tea," then boiling it with sugar, Meyer lemon, and orange. This mixture is then left to ferment for two weeks at room temperature before being strained again and served or refrigerated. Cleanliness is emphasized throughout the process.
