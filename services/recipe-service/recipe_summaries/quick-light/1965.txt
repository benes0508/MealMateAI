This recipe details how to make Salted Caramel Ice Cream from scratch. It involves two main components: creating a rich salted caramel sauce by cooking sugar, adding cream and salt, and preparing a vanilla bean-infused custard base from milk, cream, and egg yolks. The warm custard is then tempered with the caramel, strained, and thoroughly chilled. Finally, the chilled custard is churned in an ice cream maker until it reaches a soft-serve consistency, then frozen further to harden, or served immediately as a gelato.
