This recipe details how to prepare a Korean Vegetable Rice Bowl, similar to Bibimbap. It features a base of warm short-grain rice topped with an assortment of individually prepared and seasoned vegetables, including blanched spinach and bean sprouts, and saut√©ed julienned carrots, zucchini, and shiitake mushrooms (with optional fiddlehead ferns). Each bowl is crowned with a fried egg, a dollop of Korean hot pepper paste (gochujang), and garnished with toasted nori and sesame seeds. Kimchi is suggested as an accompaniment.
