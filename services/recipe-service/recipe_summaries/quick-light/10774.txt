This recipe details how to make "Cooler-Pressed Sandwiches" featuring a filling of roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella (bocconcini) with its oil/marinade, and optional herbs, packed into a hollowed baguette. The unique method involves tightly wrapping the assembled sandwich and then placing it at the bottom of a cooler, allowing the weight of other contents to compress it and its juices to soak into the bread for enhanced flavor.
