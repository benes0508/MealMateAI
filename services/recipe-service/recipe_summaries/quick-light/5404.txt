Porotos Granados is a traditional Chilean vegetable and bean stew. It features beans (pinto, navy, or cannellini), squash (butternut or red kuri), green beans, and corn, simmered in vegetable stock with aromatics like onion, garlic, paprika, and oregano. The dish is prepared by sautÃ©ing vegetables, then simmering with beans and stock until tender, adding squash, green beans, and corn in stages, and finally seasoning well.
