A fresh, Japanese-style Tekka Don (tuna rice bowl) featuring sushi-grade tuna and avocado cubes briefly marinated in a savory, spicy (from tobanjan), and slightly sweet soy-mirin sauce. It's served over warm short-grain white rice and garnished with nori, fresh shiso leaves or scallions, and toasted sesame seeds for a quick, flavorful meal.
