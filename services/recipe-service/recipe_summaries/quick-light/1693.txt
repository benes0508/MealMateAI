This recipe is for a homemade **Garlic and Achiote Fermented Hot Sauce**. It involves fermenting a mixture of chopped red chiles, garlic, salt, and sugar for 2-5 days. Separately, olive oil is infused with achiote seeds and smoked paprika. Finally, two-thirds of the fermented chile mixture is blended with the infused oil and white vinegar, then combined with the remaining fermented chiles for texture. The hot sauce can be stored refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
