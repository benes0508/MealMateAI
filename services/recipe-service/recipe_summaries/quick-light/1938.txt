This recipe features grilled scallops seasoned with a vibrant dry rub of pasilla chiles, various spices, and lime zest. They are served alongside a creamy, savory corn accompaniment, made by slowly cooking grated corn with green garlic (or leeks), shallots, and garlic until it achieves a risotto-like consistency. The dish is finished with butter and salt, and served with fresh lime wedges.
