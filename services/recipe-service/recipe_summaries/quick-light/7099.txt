This recipe provides instructions for making Carrot Potato Latkes. It involves coarsely shredding carrots, potatoes, and onion, then thoroughly squeezing out excess liquid (after coating with lemon juice). The drained mixture is combined with flour and eggs, then portioned and pan-fried in hot oil until golden brown and crispy. Finished latkes are kept warm in a low oven.
