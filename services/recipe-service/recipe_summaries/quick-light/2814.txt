**Beer-Can Cabbage** is a unique grilled side dish featuring a whole purple cabbage. A cavity is cored out and a half-full can of pale lager is inserted, allowing the cabbage to cook upright on a medium-high grill. The cabbage is basted throughout cooking with barbecue sauce, resulting in crispy outer leaves and a tender, flavorful interior. After grilling, it's sliced and tossed with more barbecue sauce, serving as a versatile side or for sandwiches. It can be prepared up to 3 days in advance.
