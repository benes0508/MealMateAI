This recipe is for Zucchini Fritters. Grated zucchini is salted and dried, then mixed with egg, flour, chives, and cornstarch. The mixture is fried in batches until golden and crisp, served with a dipping sauce made from rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Fritters can be made 30 minutes ahead and kept warm.
