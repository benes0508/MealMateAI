This recipe features **Hoisin-Glazed Pork Chops** made with a homemade, Asian-inspired sauce. Bone-in pork chops are marinated in a savory-sweet and slightly spicy sauce (made from soy sauce, honey, vinegar, tahini, sriracha, and garlic), then pan-seared or grilled until golden brown and cooked through. The finished chops are served with the reserved sauce spooned over. Both the sauce and the marinated pork can be prepared ahead of time.
