This recipe details an oven-roasted paella featuring Spanish short-grain rice cooked with saffron-infused stock, onion, garlic, tomato paste, and paprika. It's topped with seasoned fresh tomato wedges and eggs, which are cracked directly into the rice before baking until tender and set. Garnish with parsley, with an optional step for a crispy bottom crust. The recipe also provides variations substituting the tomatoes and eggs with ingredients like eggplant, mushrooms, spinach, or fava beans/limas/edamame.
