This recipe features snapper fillets baked with a spicy harissa-infused olive oil. New potatoes and spring onions are roasted until tender with part of the harissa mixture, then the harissa-rubbed fish is added to the pan and broiled until cooked through and lightly browned. It's served with fresh lemon wedges.
