Grilled Hot Dog Tortas (Tortas de salchicha) are prepared by grilling halved beef hot dogs and buttered rolls until golden. The rolls are assembled with layers of refried black beans, American cheese, Mexican crema, and mustard. The hot dogs are then placed on the cheese-covered bun bottoms and heated until the cheese melts, before being topped with optional pickled jalape√±os, onions, and avocado, and covered with the bun tops.
