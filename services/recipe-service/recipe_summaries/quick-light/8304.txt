This recipe details how to make Roasted Potatoes with Bacon, Onions, and Sage. It involves first crisping bacon and reserving its drippings. Baby potatoes and red onions are then tossed with half of the fresh sage, melted butter, bacon drippings, salt, and pepper. This mixture is roasted at 375°F for an hour, then the cooked bacon is stirred in, and roasting continues at 400°F for another 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender and browned. The dish is finished with the remaining fresh sage and can be prepared up to two hours in advance.
