This Fuyu Persimmon Relish is a sweet and savory condiment featuring diced fuyu persimmons, rehydrated currants, and onions, cooked down with sherry, sherry vinegar, and mustard seed. Half of the relish is pur√©ed and then combined with the rest for a varied texture. It requires refrigeration for at least 24 hours for flavors to meld, making it an excellent make-ahead accompaniment.
