This recipe details how to make cured egg yolks. The process involves salting egg yolks with a mixture of kosher salt and sugar, chilling them for four days, and then gently drying them in a low-temperature oven (150Â°F) until they achieve a firm, grate-able texture similar to hard cheese. They can be stored refrigerated for up to a month.
