This recipe details how to prepare **Roast Lamb with Artichokes and Lemons**. A bone-in lamb shoulder is seasoned, browned, and then slow-roasted in the oven for several hours with white wine, crushed tomatoes, garlic, and lemons until fall-apart tender. Baby artichokes are added later to cook alongside the lamb. Finally, the dish is served with a fresh herb and anchovy oil drizzled over the lamb, artichokes, and pan juices.
