This recipe details how to prepare an "Amaranth 'Risotto' With Mushrooms," a savory dish using amaranth in place of rice. It involves two main steps: first, simmering amaranth with rehydrated porcini mushroom liquid and water until tender; and second, separately saut√©ing rehydrated porcini and fresh mushrooms with garlic, soy sauce, and sherry. The cooked amaranth and mushroom mixture are then combined with butter and fresh thyme before serving.
