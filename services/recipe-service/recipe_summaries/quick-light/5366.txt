This recipe is for **Spaghetti with Sun Gold Tomato Sauce**. It features a light, aromatic sauce made from sun gold or cherry tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs (basil, thyme, tarragon) subtly flavored with star anise and clove. The sauce is cooked until it forms, then tossed with al dente spaghetti, using pasta water to create a coated finish. The sauce can be prepared a day ahead.
