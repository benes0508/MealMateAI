This recipe is for a **Wine-Braised Leg of Lamb with Garlic**. A large bone-in leg of lamb is seasoned with minced garlic, salt, and pepper, then roasted with halved garlic heads and fresh thyme. It's initially seared at high heat, then slow-braised for nearly 3 hours with a bottle of dry white wine until very tender. The pan juices are then reduced with butter and more minced garlic to create a savory jus to serve over the sliced lamb.
