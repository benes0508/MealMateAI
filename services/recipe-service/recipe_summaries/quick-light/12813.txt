This recipe details how to prepare "Trout with Haricots Verts and Almonds." It involves cleaning whole rainbow trout, blanching haricots verts, then pan-frying the trout until lightly cooked. Separately, the beans are heated with butter. Finally, a browned butter sauce with toasted almonds, parsley, and lemon juice is spooned over the trout and haricots verts for a complete dish.
