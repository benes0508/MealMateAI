Tangerine Bavarian is a **no-bake, chilled dessert** featuring a light, airy mousse-like consistency. It's prepared by cooking a base of fresh **tangerine juice and zest, egg yolks, and sugar**, then thickening it with gelatin. This mixture is cooled and then lightened by gently folding in **whipped heavy cream**. The dessert is spooned into a springform pan and chilled until set (at least 4 hours), often accompanied by tangerine caramel sauce and candied peel.
