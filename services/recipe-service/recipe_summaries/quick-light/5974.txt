This recipe is for a Grill-Roasted Turkey, prepared by brining, stuffing with apple, orange, and onion, then buttering and seasoning. It's cooked indirectly on a charcoal grill at 350°F for about 2 hours 45 minutes, rotating periodically, until the thigh reaches 165°F. The turkey is then rested for an hour before carving.
