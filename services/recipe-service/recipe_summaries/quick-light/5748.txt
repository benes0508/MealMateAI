This recipe features spaghetti tossed with mussels and cannellini white beans in a savory tomato sauce. The sauce is built with garlic, red pepper flakes, and dry white wine, with the mussels cooked directly in it until they open. The al dente pasta is then combined with the mussels, beans, and sauce, finished with fresh parsley and olive oil.
