This recipe transforms Brussels sprouts by first boiling them until tender-crisp, then saut√©ing them with olive oil, garlic, hot red pepper flakes, fresh nutmeg, and finally tossing with melted Parmesan cheese. It aims to make Brussels sprouts appealing, even for those who typically dislike them, by focusing on proper texture and a savory, aromatic flavor profile.
