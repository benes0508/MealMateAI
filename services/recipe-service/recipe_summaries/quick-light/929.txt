"Glazed Shallots with Chile and Thyme" features pan-seared shallots caramelized until golden, then simmered in a sweet, tangy, and subtly spicy glaze made with sherry/red wine vinegar, thyme, red Fresno chiles, and sugar. The dish is finished by roasting in the oven until the shallots are tender and coated in the rich glaze. It serves as a flavorful side dish or accompaniment.
