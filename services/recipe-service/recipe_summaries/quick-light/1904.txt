This recipe details how to prepare **Grilled Bone-In Rib Eye** steaks. Steaks are prepped by drying and seasoning generously with salt and pepper the night before, then chilled uncovered. Before grilling, they are brought to room temperature. The cooking involves searing the steaks over direct medium-high heat until charred, then moving to indirect heat to brown, and finally searing the bone and fat-cap sides. Steaks are cooked until they reach 120Â°F for rare, then rested for 20 minutes before slicing and serving with flaky sea salt.
