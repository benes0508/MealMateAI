This recipe is for Peruvian Tacu Tacu, a dish of rice and lentils. Brown lentils are simmered until tender, then combined with white rice cooked with garlic. A sautéed mixture of red onion, garlic, and ají amarillo/mirasol paste is stirred into the rice and lentil mixture. The combined dish is then fried in a skillet, flattened, and repeatedly stirred to create a golden-brown crust throughout.
