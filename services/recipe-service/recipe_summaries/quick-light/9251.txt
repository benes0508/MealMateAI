This recipe features long-cooked, tender greens (like collards, chard, and kale) enriched with savory bacon drippings. They are served with a sweet and tangy cider gastrique, made by caramelizing sugar and simmering with apple cider vinegar and red pepper. A garnish of crispy, deep-fried shallots adds texture and a savory crunch.
