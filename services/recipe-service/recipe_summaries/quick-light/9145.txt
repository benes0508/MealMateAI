Spiced Lentil Tacos feature seasoned brown lentils cooked with taco seasoning, onion, and garlic for a flavorful, spicy filling. The dish is served in taco shells with a zesty chipotle-spiced sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar cheese. The lentils are simmered until tender, then mashed for texture.
