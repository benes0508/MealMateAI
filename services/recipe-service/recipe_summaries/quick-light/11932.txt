Ash-Roasted Batatas with Lime-Cumin Butter is a recipe for **sweet potatoes** cooked directly in the **embers/coals of a charcoal grill** (or **oven-roasted** as an alternative). The batatas are wrapped in heavy-duty foil and roasted until tender, then peeled, sliced, and served with a flavorful **lime-cumin butter** seasoned with parsley, salt, and pepper. Grilling takes approximately 45-50 minutes.
