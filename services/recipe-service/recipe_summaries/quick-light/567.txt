Tomato Fried Rice combines long-grain rice stir-fried with saut√©ed tomatoes, scallions, garlic, ginger, and scrambled eggs, seasoned with soy and sesame oils. A unique element is the topping of fresh, salted tomatoes, along with green scallion tops, a drizzle of olive oil, and lemon zest for brightness. Optional red pepper flakes add a hint of spice.
