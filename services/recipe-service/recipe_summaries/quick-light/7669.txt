This is a rich, flavorful Bourbon and Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce. It combines ketchup, bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, soy sauce, Dijon, liquid smoke, and classic BBQ spices (onion, garlic, red pepper, black pepper). The sauce is simmered for about 10 minutes until reduced to 2 cups, and can be made up to two weeks ahead.
