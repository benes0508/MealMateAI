This recipe details how to make Chicken Taquitos using a convenient filling of shredded store-bought roasted chicken mixed with barbecue sauce, sour cream, green chiles, corn, red onion, garlic, smoked gouda, and Monterey Jack cheeses, seasoned with cumin and chile powder. The mixture is rolled into flour tortillas, secured with toothpicks, and then pan-fried in vegetable oil until golden brown. Serve hot with salsa and guacamole.
