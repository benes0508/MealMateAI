Magic Cèpe Mushroom Soup is a creamy, deeply flavorful soup centered on dried cèpe (porcini) mushrooms. The unique preparation involves grinding dried mushrooms into a powder and infusing it into heavy cream, which is then combined with stock and gently simmered. It can be prepared in advance and is served garnished with fresh chives and oil. Optional additions include fresh mushrooms or truffles for enhanced flavor and texture.
