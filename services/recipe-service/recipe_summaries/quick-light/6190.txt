"Shiny Happy Poppers" is a vegan recipe for grilled jalapeño poppers. Jalapeños are stemmed, deseeded, and filled with a mixture of cooked rice, black beans, vegan Dijon mustard, garlic, and thyme. They are then drizzled with olive oil and hot sauce, wrapped in a foil packet, and grilled until soft and hot.
