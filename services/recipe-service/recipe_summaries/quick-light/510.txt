This recipe details how to prepare Boiled Peanuts with Chile Salt. Fresh or raw shell-on peanuts are first brined in a mixture of water, kosher salt, and coriander seeds, then boiled for 2 to 4.5 hours until very tender. A separate chile salt seasoning is made by crushing coriander seeds and mixing them with flaky sea salt and red chile powder. The cooled, drained peanuts are then tossed with most of this spice blend and served, with the remaining seasoning offered on the side.
