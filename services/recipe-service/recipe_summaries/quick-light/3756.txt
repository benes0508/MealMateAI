This recipe for Grilled Fennel-Rubbed Triple-Cut Pork Chops features thick pork chops seasoned with a fennel, salt, and pepper rub. The chops are grilled in a two-stage process: first, seared over direct heat for browning, then slow-cooked over indirect heat until 118Â°F for juicy results. After resting, the loin is separated from the bone, both are briefly grilled again to crisp the bones and reheat the loin, then sliced and served with a drizzle of olive oil, flaky sea salt, and fennel pollen.
