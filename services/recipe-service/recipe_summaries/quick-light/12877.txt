These grilled sandwiches feature diagonal slices of baguette filled with sharp cheddar and thinly sliced fennel. They are spread with a homemade curry mayonnaise, prepared by cooking shallots and Madras curry powder with mayo and lemon juice. The sandwiches are buttered and skillet-grilled until golden brown with melted cheese.
