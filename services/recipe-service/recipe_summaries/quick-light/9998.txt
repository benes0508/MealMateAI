This recipe features capellini pasta with succulent shrimp in a rich, creamy tomato sauce. The sauce is infused with garlic, oregano, a touch of sweet red vermouth for depth, and brightened with fresh lemon juice. The dish is prepared by quickly searing the shrimp, then building the flavorful sauce in the same pan, and serving it over al dente capellini.
