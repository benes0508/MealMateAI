A homemade Cranberry Chutney that is sweet, tangy, and slightly spicy. It features fresh or frozen cranberries, sweetened with brown sugar and pineapple juice, balanced with apple cider vinegar, and spiced with golden raisins, hot pepper flakes, and ground cloves. It's easily prepared by simmering all ingredients together for about 12 minutes and requires chilling for at least 8 hours to allow flavors to fully develop.
