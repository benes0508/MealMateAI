These Spicy Pork Belly Sliders feature tender pork belly marinated overnight in a gochujang-based Korean marinade with soy, garlic, sugar, sake, mirin, and sesame oil. The marinated pork is then pan-fried (or grilled) until caramelized and golden brown. Served on toasted slider buns with mayonnaise and fresh cucumber matchsticks, they offer a delicious balance of spicy, savory, and fresh flavors.
