This recipe details preparing Beef Tenderloin with Mushrooms and Espagnole Sauce. Beef tenderloin pieces are first seared in a skillet, then roasted in the oven to a medium-rare finish. Concurrently, cremini mushrooms are saut√©ed. A rich sauce is made by deglazing the beef roasting pan with sherry, then combining it with espagnole sauce and the cooked mushrooms. The sliced beef is served with the warm mushroom-espagnole sauce.
