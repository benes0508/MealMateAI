Spaghetti with Garlic is a simple pasta dish highlighting abundant, thinly sliced garlic gently cooked in olive oil until golden and crispy. The pasta is tossed with the garlic-infused oil, red pepper flakes, fresh lemon zest, and parsley. Half of the crispy garlic is incorporated, with the rest used as a garnish for texture. Optionally served with Parmigiano-Reggiano.
