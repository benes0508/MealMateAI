This recipe for Simple Candied Orange Peel uses oranges, sugar, and water. It involves preparing orange peel strips (including pith), blanching them in boiling water, then simmering them in a sugar syrup until very soft. The softened peel is then tossed with additional sugar and air-dried for 1-2 days until coated and dry. The candied peel can be frozen for up to two months.
