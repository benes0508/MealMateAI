**Smoked Swordfish Tostaditas** are a savory, Mexican-inspired appetizer. Shredded smoked swordfish is simmered in a rich, slightly smoky sauce made from rehydrated morita chile, tomatoes, and a cooked-down aromatic base of onion, carrot, and leek. This flavorful mixture is served on crispy, small fried corn tortilla rounds, topped with creamy avocado and garnished with crispy fried leek strips.
