This recipe for Poached Shrimp with Lemon-Horseradish Dipping Sauce involves gently poaching large shrimp in a flavorful broth of white wine, lemon, peppercorns, and bay leaf. The shrimp are then chilled, peeled, and deveined. A zesty dipping sauce is prepared by reducing the poaching liquid and combining it with crème fraîche (or sour cream), chopped chives, prepared white horseradish, and lemon peel. The dish can be made a day ahead and is served with shrimp arranged around glasses of the dipping sauce.
