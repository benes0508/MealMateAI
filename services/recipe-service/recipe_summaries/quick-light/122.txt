This recipe details how to make 8 homemade flour tortillas from scratch. It uses all-purpose flour, pork lard (or vegetable shortening), salt, and hot water. The dough is mixed, kneaded, rested, then rolled thin and quickly cooked on a hot skillet until lightly puffed and speckled brown, resulting in soft and pliable tortillas.
