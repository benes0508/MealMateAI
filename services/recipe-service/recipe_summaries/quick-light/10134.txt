This gourmet grilled cheese features sourdough bread brushed with olive oil, layered with savory onion (or fig) jam on one slice and melty Taleggio (or Italian Fontina) cheese with fresh escarole on the other. It's cooked in a dry skillet, pressed, until golden-brown and the cheese is melted, typically in 6-8 minutes.
