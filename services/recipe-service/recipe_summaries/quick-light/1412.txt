A recipe for vibrant hot-pink pearl onion pickles. These quick pickles are made by briefly simmering pearl onions in a flavorful brine of white wine vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander, tarragon, and mint, with a beet added temporarily for color. They require at least 2 hours of chilling before serving, developing a tangy, aromatic, and slightly mellow flavor.
