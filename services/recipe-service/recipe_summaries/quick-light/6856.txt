Carom Seeds Poori is a traditional Indian fried bread made from whole wheat and all-purpose flours, distinctively flavored with coarsely ground carom seeds (ajwain). A firm dough is prepared, kneaded, and rested, then portioned and rolled into small disks. These are deep-fried in hot oil until golden brown and puffed, often requiring gentle pressing to ensure they fully inflate. They are drained and best served immediately.
