This recipe is for "Eggs with Pickled Shallot and Parsley." It involves boiling eggs for 8 minutes to achieve a slightly wobbly center, then cooling and slicing them. Concurrently, finely chopped shallots are "pickled" in lemon juice for 10 minutes, then combined with fresh parsley and seasoned with salt. The sliced eggs are arranged and topped with this shallot-parsley mixture.
