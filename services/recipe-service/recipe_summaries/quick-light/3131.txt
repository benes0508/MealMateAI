This recipe describes how to make **Sausage Meatball Sandwiches**. Italian sausage is formed into meatballs, browned, and then simmered in a homemade tomato sauce with fennel, onion, and garlic. Hoagie rolls are toasted with a basil-garlic oil, filled with the meatballs and sauce, topped with mozzarella, and broiled until melted and bubbly, finished with more basil.
