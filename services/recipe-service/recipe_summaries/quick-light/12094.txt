This recipe features Belgian endives braised until tender in a flavorful liquid of chicken broth, lemon juice, butter, sugar, and salt. Haricots verts (thin green beans) are blanched separately and then gently folded in with the endives to heat through, creating a delicate and tender vegetable side dish.
