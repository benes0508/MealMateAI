This recipe is for a **Chard and Salami Frittata**. It involves saut√©ing onions, Swiss chard, salami, and garlic, then adding a whisked egg mixture with cheese, salt, and pepper to a skillet. The frittata is cooked on the stovetop until almost set, topped with more cheese, and then finished briefly under the broiler until set and lightly browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.
