Pico de Gallo Verde is a refreshing, green salsa made by finely chopping and tossing together Persian cucumbers, avocado, celery, poblano and jalape√±o chiles, scallions, garlic, and a unique addition of roasted pistachios. Fresh lime juice, cilantro, mint, olive oil, and salt season the mix, which is chilled before serving with tortilla or plantain chips.
