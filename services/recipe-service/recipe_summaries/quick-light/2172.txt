This recipe details how to make **Veggie Sushi Hand Rolls** using seasoned short-grain brown rice and an assortment of matchstick-cut fresh vegetables (carrot, cucumber, red and yellow bell peppers, chives). Each hand roll is assembled by spreading rice and vegetables on a half-sheet of nori seaweed and then rolling it into a cone shape. They are typically served with optional low-sodium soy sauce for dipping.
