"Noodles with Chilled Tomato Broth" is a refreshing, light noodle dish. It features a cold, strained broth made from ripe red tomatoes, garlic, rice vinegar, and sugar. Thin noodles are served topped with this chilled broth, alongside thinly sliced egg crepes, crisp Persian cucumbers, scallions, and cilantro, with hot chili paste on the side for an optional spicy kick. The tomato broth can be prepared ahead of time.
