An easy-to-prepare pasta dish featuring bucatini tossed with a rich black olive tapenade, sun-dried tomatoes, and fresh basil and parsley. The al dente pasta is briefly warmed with the tapenade in a skillet before the fresh ingredients are added off-heat. Finished with olive oil and shaved Parmesan, it offers a quick and flavorful Mediterranean-inspired meal.
