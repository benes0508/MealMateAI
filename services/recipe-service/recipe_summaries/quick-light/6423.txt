This recipe details a classic Roast Chicken, emphasizing a crucial overnight (8 hours to 2 days) salt rub and chill for enhanced flavor and crispy skin. It features a two-stage roasting process: initial high-heat searing (500°F) for browning, followed by a lower temperature (350°F) cook, with frequent butter basting, until the thigh reaches 165°F. Essential resting periods ensure a moist, golden result.
