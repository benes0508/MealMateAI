This recipe features roasted garnet yams (or other red-skinned sweet potatoes) sliced and topped with a rich brown-butter vinaigrette, made with shallot, garlic, Dijon mustard, and red wine vinegar. The dish is finished with crispy, deep-fried yam skins, providing a textural contrast to the tender yams.
