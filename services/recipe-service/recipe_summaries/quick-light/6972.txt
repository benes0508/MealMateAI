This recipe features pork belly slow-roasted with agave, water, and a mix of poblano, habanero, and serrano chiles. The tender pork is then pressed, chilled, and grilled until crisp. It's served alongside grilled pineapple, with a sweet and spicy glaze made by reducing the rich pan juices and reserved chiles. A final drizzle of apple cider vinegar brightens the complex flavors.
