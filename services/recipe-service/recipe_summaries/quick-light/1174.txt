This recipe details how to create a refreshing dessert by dipping chilled strawberries into a vibrant matcha-infused white chocolate coating, finished with black and white sesame seeds. The shell is prepared by melting white chocolate with matcha, coconut oil, and salt, then quickly chilling the mixture before the berries are dipped and refrigerated until set.
