This recipe is for **Turkey Reubens**, a twist on the classic Reuben sandwich. It involves making a creamy sauce from mayonnaise, ketchup, sweet pickle relish, and cider vinegar, spreading it on **rye bread**, and filling with **sliced cooked turkey, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese**. The sandwiches are then **pan-fried in butter** until golden brown and the cheese is melted.
