This recipe details how to make a Fried Fish Sandwich with Pepper Slaw. It involves marinating thinly sliced onions, jalape√±os, and poblanos in a citrus and herb mixture for the slaw, and preparing a quick tartar sauce. Black bass fillets are coated in a crispy batter made with flour, cornstarch, and spices, then fried until golden. The sandwich is assembled on toasted potato buns with tomato slices, tartar sauce, fried fish, and the strained pepper slaw.
