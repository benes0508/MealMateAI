This recipe details how to make Caribbean-inspired Ackee Tacos with "Island Guacamole." The flavorful ackee filling is created by saut√©ing aromatics like onion, garlic, bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet with ackee and spices. The unique "Island Guacamole" features avocado combined with tropical fruits (pineapple or mango), citrus juices, and a hint of Scotch bonnet. Tacos are served assembly-line style, allowing diners to fill shells with the ackee mixture, guacamole, cheese, and shredded lettuce.
