This recipe features pan-sautÃ©ed eggplant semicircles topped with red bell pepper strips and crumbled feta cheese. The dish is briefly reheated until the cheese softens, then served on butter lettuce leaves, garnished with chopped green olives and fresh oregano. It can be partially prepared up to two hours ahead.
