"Ranch Fun Dip" is a homemade dry spice blend designed to mimic the flavor of ranch dressing, served as a dip with crudit√©s. It's made by toasting and grinding pistachios with nutritional yeast and salt, then mixing in Aleppo pepper, dill, sugar, onion powder, and garlic powder. It can be prepared up to two weeks in advance.
