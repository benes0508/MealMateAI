This recipe features soft goat cheese rounds served with a crackling caramel syrup. The caramel is prepared and used to coat grape clusters and apple wedges, which are then served alongside the cheese. Additional caramel is drizzled over the individual goat cheese portions, creating a balance of tangy, sweet, and crisp textures.
