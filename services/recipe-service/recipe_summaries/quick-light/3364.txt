This recipe is for **Pan-Roasted Chicken with Pineapple-Chile Glaze**. Chicken halves are seasoned with a coriander, cumin, and cayenne rub, then pan-seared and oven-roasted on a bed of pineapple slices until cooked through. Concurrently, a sweet, tangy, and spicy glaze is prepared from pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, serrano chile, garlic, and paprika. The cooked chicken is then brushed with this syrupy glaze and briefly roasted to caramelize.
