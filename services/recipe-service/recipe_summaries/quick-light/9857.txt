This recipe features pan-seared lamb rib chops, served with a quick, sweet-tart pan sauce. The sauce is made from black cherry juice, fresh Bing cherries, and saut√©ed red onion, finished with fresh basil. The chops are briefly dredged and seared, then kept warm while the sauce is prepared in the same skillet.
