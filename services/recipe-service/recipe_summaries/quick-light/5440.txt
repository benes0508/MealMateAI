This recipe is for "Beer-Can Chicken," where a whole chicken (3.5-4 lbs) is seasoned with a 4-3-2-1 spice rub, then placed upright on a half-full can of light lager. It's grilled over indirect high heat with a water-filled drip pan for 45-60 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F. After resting, it's served with pan drippings.
