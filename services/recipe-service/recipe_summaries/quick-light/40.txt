Mango Curry is a vegetarian, Indian/Thai-inspired dish made with unripe green mangoes, shallots, green chiles, ginger, and garlic, marinated and then simmered in coconut milk. It features a tempered spice mixture of black mustard seeds, dried red chiles, and curry leaves. Served hot with basmati rice, it can be garnished with fried onions.
