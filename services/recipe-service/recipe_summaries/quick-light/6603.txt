**Gingered Pickled Carrots:** This recipe outlines how to make crisp, tangy pickled carrots with a zesty ginger kick. Carrots are cut, combined with fresh ginger, and packed into jars, then covered with a hot brine made from vinegar, turbinado sugar, and salt. Best after 1-2 days, they have a refrigerated shelf life of about 10 days or 6-8 months if properly hot-canned.
