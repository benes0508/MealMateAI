This recipe details how to make a rich, caramel-colored beef stock. It involves first roasting beef bones and vegetables (celery, onion, carrots) with tomato paste. Separately, garlic is toasted in olive oil, with the garlic added to the stock and the infused oil reserved. All ingredients, including herbs and spices, are then simmered in water for approximately 3 hours before straining. The stock can be chilled or frozen for future use.
