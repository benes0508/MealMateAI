This recipe details how to make **Broccoli Bolognese with Orecchiette**. It involves cooking broccoli until crisp-tender, then chopping it. A sauce is prepared by browning Italian sausage with garlic and red pepper flakes, then combining it with blanched broccoli and a little pasta water. Orecchiette pasta is cooked until barely al dente, then finished in the skillet with the sauce, butter, and grated Parmesan to create a glossy, emulsified dish, served with more cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.
