**Peppermint Meringues:** These light, crisp meringues are flavored with peppermint extract and visually enhanced with swirled red food coloring. Made from egg whites and sugars, they are piped into small rounds and baked slowly at a low temperature (200Â°F) for about 2.5 hours until dry, then cooled until crisp. They can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and stored airtight.
