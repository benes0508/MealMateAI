This recipe is for **Sake Sea Bass in Parchment**, an Asian-inspired fish dish. Skinless sea bass fillets are seasoned with a mixture of sake, soy sauce, grated ginger, and sugar, along with scallions, then enclosed in parchment paper pouches. These are baked at 400Â°F for 10-12 minutes until the fish is cooked through.
