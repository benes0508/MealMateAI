This recipe features classic deviled eggs, elevated with the addition of fresh tarragon, capers, minced shallot, and celery for a bright, briny flavor profile. Hard-boiled yolks are mashed with olive oil, mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard, then mixed with the unique additions before being spooned back into the egg whites and garnished with celery. It can be prepared up to 4 hours in advance.
