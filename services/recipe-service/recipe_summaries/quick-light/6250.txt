This recipe describes how to make a **White Miso Peach/Pear/Apple Ice Cream**. It involves caramelizing selected fruit (peaches, pears, or apples) with sugar, then blending it with white miso to create a flavorful purée. This purée is then incorporated into a rich custard base made from cream, milk, sugar, and egg yolks. After chilling, the mixture is churned in an ice cream maker to achieve a unique frozen dessert.
