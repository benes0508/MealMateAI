This Meringues recipe creates light, airy desserts using egg whites, granulated and superfine sugars, cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla/almond extract. The process involves gradually beating sugars into foamy egg whites until stiff and glossy, piping them, and then baking at a low temperature (250Â°F) for about an hour, followed by an extended drying period in the turned-off oven.
