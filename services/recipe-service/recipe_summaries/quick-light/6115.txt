This recipe details how to prepare **Ember-Roasted Corn on the Cob**. Six ears of corn are prepped by pulling back the husks, removing silk, then recovering the kernels with the husks, and soaking. They are then roasted directly in hot, ash-covered charcoal coals for about 10 minutes until deeply golden brown. Serve with butter and salt.
