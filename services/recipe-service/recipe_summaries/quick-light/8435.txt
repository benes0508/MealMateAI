This is a vibrant Thai dipping sauce featuring toasted, ground jasmine rice and dried chiles for texture and heat. It's balanced with fresh herbs (scallion, mint, cilantro), savory fish sauce, tangy lime juice, and a touch of sweetness. Prepared by toasting rice and chiles, then simply mixing with the remaining fresh and liquid ingredients.
