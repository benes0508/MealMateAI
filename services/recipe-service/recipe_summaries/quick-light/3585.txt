This recipe is for **Graham Cracker Chocolate Dipped Ice Cream Sandwiches**. It involves spreading softened ice cream (any flavor) into a pan, freezing it overnight, then cutting it into squares. These ice cream squares are sandwiched between graham cracker halves, with an optional step of dipping the graham crackers in melted chocolate before assembly. The finished sandwiches are then frozen again briefly before serving.
