This recipe for "R-Rated Onions" details how to slowly caramelize large quantities of thinly sliced yellow or white onions. The process involves cooking the onions with oil and salt in a skillet over medium-high then medium-low heat, covered for about 45 minutes, then uncovered, stirring frequently. Water can be added to deglaze the pan. The goal is a soft, creamy, deeply caramelized "mahogany" pile of onions, which keep well refrigerated or frozen.
