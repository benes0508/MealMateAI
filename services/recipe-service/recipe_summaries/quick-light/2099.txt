This Cheesy Chicken Enchilada Skillet is a quick, oven-finished dish featuring shredded rotisserie chicken, black beans, and corn tortillas coated in a savory red salsa and sour cream sauce. Prepared mostly on the stovetop in a single skillet and finished in the oven with melted Mexican cheese, it's optionally garnished with sour cream, jalape√±os, and cilantro.
