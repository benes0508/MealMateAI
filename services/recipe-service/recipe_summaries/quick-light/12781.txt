This recipe details how to make a **Rich Beef Broth with Carrot**. It involves roasting beef short ribs/shanks and vegetables (onions, celery, carrots) until well browned, then simmering them with herbs and spices for 7-8 hours to create a deeply flavorful broth. After chilling and defatting, the broth is strained and served warm with finely diced cooked carrots, while the short rib meat is reserved for other uses.
