This recipe details how to make a crunchy Almond-Pistachio Nougatine. It involves creating a light caramel from sugar and corn syrup, then quickly incorporating sliced almonds, chopped pistachios, and butter. The warm mixture is rolled out thinly and cut into shapes, resulting in a crisp, sweet, nutty brittle that can be stored for up to a month.
