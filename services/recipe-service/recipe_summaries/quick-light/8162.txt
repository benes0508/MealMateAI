This recipe details how to prepare a **New York Strip Roast with Madeira Pan Sauce**. The roast is seasoned with salt, pepper, and allspice, seared, then oven-roasted to medium-rare. A rich pan sauce is made using shallots, Madeira wine, chicken broth, and finished with frozen butter. The meat is sliced and served with the sauce, with a wine pairing suggestion of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
