Vegetarian Spring Rolls are prepared by saut√©ing a mix of vegetables, including onions, garlic, ginger, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, kale, napa cabbage, and scallions. This savory filling is seasoned with a soy, rice vinegar, and sesame oil sauce, then wrapped in spring roll wrappers and pan-fried until golden brown.
