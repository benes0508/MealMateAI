This Stewed-Tomato Bruschetta features grilled sourdough bread topped with a savory, slowly cooked tomato mixture. The stew blends tomatoes with celery, onion, and Italian frying pepper, uniquely flavored with garlic, bay leaves, whole cloves, and a touch of curry powder and brown sugar. The preparation involves infusing olive oil with aromatics, which is then used for cooking the stew and brushing the bread before grilling, with crispy garlic serving as a final garnish.
