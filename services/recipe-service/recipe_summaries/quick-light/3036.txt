This **Easy One-Pot Caprese Pasta** is a quick and simple pasta dish combining whole wheat rigatoni, crushed and grape tomatoes, string cheese, onion, fresh basil, garlic, salt, and pepper cooked together in a single pot. It's brought to a boil, then simmered uncovered for 25-30 minutes until the pasta is tender. Serve drizzled with balsamic vinegar, optionally garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan.
