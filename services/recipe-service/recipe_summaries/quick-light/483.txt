A vibrant and spicy vegetarian take on traditional Larb, featuring savory pan-fried shiitake mushrooms tossed with fresh aromatics like ginger, garlic, and scallions, and a bright, zesty dressing of fish sauce, shallots, red chiles, and cooling mint. It's garnished with crunchy peanuts and served with crisp cabbage leaves for scooping.
