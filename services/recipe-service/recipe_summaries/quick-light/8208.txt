This recipe details how to prepare Smothered Pork Chops with Mushrooms. Bone-in pork chops are seasoned, dredged in flour, and browned. Onions, cremini mushrooms, and rosemary are then saut√©ed in the same skillet. Finally, the chops are returned to the skillet with water and simmered until tender, resulting in savory pork in a rich mushroom and onion sauce.
