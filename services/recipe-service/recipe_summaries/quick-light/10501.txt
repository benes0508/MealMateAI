This recipe details how to prepare a **Herb and Mustard Turkey with Green Onion Gravy**. Aromatic herb-mustard butter (made with butter, green onion, parsley, thyme, sage, and Dijon) is spread under the turkey's skin before roasting it at 325°F with stock. After the turkey rests, a savory gravy is made from the reserved pan juices, additional stock, cream, cornstarch, sautéed green onions, and fresh herbs.
