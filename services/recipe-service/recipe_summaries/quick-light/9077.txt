This recipe details making a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich featuring slow-braised pulled beef short ribs and pickled red onions. Beef short ribs are first seared, then braised for four hours with aromatic vegetables, red wine, and beef broth until very tender, then shredded. The sandwich is assembled with sourdough bread, layers of Bel Paese cheese, pickled red onions, and the pulled short ribs. Finally, it's buttered, pan-fried until golden, and finished in the oven for a melted, crispy result.
