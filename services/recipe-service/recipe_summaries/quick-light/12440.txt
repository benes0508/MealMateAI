The Root Beer Granita Float is a refreshing dessert that transforms root beer into an icy granita and a concentrated syrup. It's assembled by layering the scraped root beer granita with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzling with the homemade root beer reduction syrup, offering a unique icy twist on a classic float.
