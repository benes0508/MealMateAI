A vegetarian penne pasta dish featuring sautÃ©ed and simmered assorted root vegetables (such as parsnips, carrots, celery root, and golden beets) and celery stalks. The pasta is combined with the tender vegetables, Parmesan cheese, fresh lemon peel, and a hint of nutmeg, then tossed in a light sauce with reserved pasta water and garnished with fresh celery leaves.
