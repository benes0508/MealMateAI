This recipe details how to make **Hot-Smoked Salmon with Tarragon Crème Fraîche**. A 4-pound salmon fillet is seasoned with salt, chilled, then hot-smoked in a cast iron skillet using mesquite/hickory wood chips and a spice blend (coriander, peppercorns, dill, celery seeds) until it reaches 120°F. Concurrently, a **Tarragon Crème Fraîche** is prepared by whisking crème fraîche with shallot, fresh tarragon, lemon zest, and salt. The salmon is cooled to room temperature and served with the crème fraîche, alongside bagels, capers, avocado, cucumber, watercress, and scallions.
