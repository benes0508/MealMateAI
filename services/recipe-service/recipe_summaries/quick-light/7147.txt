Leaving-Home Penne Rigate with Broccoli is a simple pasta dish where penne and broccoli are boiled together in heavily salted water. After draining, they are tossed with extra virgin olive oil and finely grated Pecorino cheese, creating a green-speckled sauce. It's finished with fresh pepper and extra cheese for serving.
