This pasta dish features a fresh and smoky sauce made from grilled tomatoes, scallions, and garlic. The charred vegetables are chopped and tossed with hot penne (or other short pasta), fresh mozzarella, and a drizzle of olive oil, using reserved pasta water to achieve the desired sauce consistency. A simple, flavorful vegetarian meal.
