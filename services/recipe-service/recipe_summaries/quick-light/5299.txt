This recipe details how to deep-fry tarantulas. It involves thawing frozen tarantulas, removing their abdomens, singeing off body hairs, coating them in tempura batter, and deep-frying until lightly browned. The spiders are then cut lengthwise, sprinkled with smoked paprika, and served, with instructions to eat the legs and mesothorax while avoiding the fangs.
