This recipe features roasted monkfish fillets cooked alongside a ratatouille-style mix of eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper, and onion. The vegetables are roasted initially, then combined with marinara sauce and garlic before the monkfish is added to the pan for the final roast. The dish is finished with fresh basil and capers.
