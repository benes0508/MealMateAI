This recipe outlines how to prepare and freeze **big batches of seasoned pork tenderloin strips** for quick future meals. Thinly sliced pork is tossed with a savory-sweet spice blend (coriander, cumin, brown sugar, salt, pepper) and portioned into freezer bags. These can be stored for up to 3 months and are ready to be quickly pan-fried for a stir-fry or added directly to boiling soup.
