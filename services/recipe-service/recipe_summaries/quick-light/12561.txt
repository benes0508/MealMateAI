This Italian-inspired pasta dish is a vegetarian twist on Spaghetti Carbonara. It features spaghetti tossed with a rich sauce made from eggs and Parmesan cheese. The sauce is combined with tender, saut√©ed zucchini and finished with fresh basil. The heat from the freshly cooked pasta emulsifies the eggs and cheese for a creamy coating.
