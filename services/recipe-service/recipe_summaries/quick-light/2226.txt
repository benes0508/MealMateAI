This recipe details how to make a flavorful Turmeric-Ginger Chicken Soup. It involves simmering a whole chicken with onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and spices to create a rich broth. The chicken is then removed, shredded, and returned to the reduced stock along with carrots. Dried udon noodles are cooked separately, then served in bowls topped with the chicken and broth, garnished with scallions and chili oil.
