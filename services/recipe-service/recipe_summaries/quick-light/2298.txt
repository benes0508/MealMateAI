This is a vegetarian Instant Pot Kidney Bean Étouffée, featuring pre-soaked dried kidney beans, bell peppers, onions, and garlic. Flavored with a Cajun-inspired blend of thyme, smoked paprika, marjoram, and cayenne, it's pressure-cooked with crushed tomatoes for a hearty stew. Served over rice with an optional side of hot sauce.
