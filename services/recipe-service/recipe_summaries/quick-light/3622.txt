This recipe details how to make Tostadas with Creamy Roasted Poblanos and Corn. It involves roasting poblano chiles until blackened, steaming, peeling, and slicing them. Corn is grilled and kernels are removed. A skillet mixture is prepared by saut√©ing onion, then adding the sliced poblanos, corn, and salt, finishing with Mexican crema. Corn tortillas are fried until crispy (or pre-made tostada shells are used). Tostadas are assembled by spreading an optional creamy black bean spread, topping with the poblano-corn mixture (rajas), shredded lettuce, sliced onion, queso fresco, and cilantro.
