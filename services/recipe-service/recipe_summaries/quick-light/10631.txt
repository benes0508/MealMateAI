This recipe for **Pork and Hominy Stew (Pozole Rojo)** features country-style pork ribs simmered until tender in a rich broth with aromatic herbs (mint, cilantro), garlic, onion, and spices. A vibrant red chile paste, made from toasted and rehydrated guajillo and ancho chiles blended with garlic, onion, and a clove, is then added to the shredded pork and hominy. The stew is briefly simmered to meld flavors and traditionally served with fresh accompaniments like avocado, crema, queso fresco, lettuce, radishes, lime, and tortilla strips.
