This recipe is for "Vegetable Latkes," a type of savory pancake made with a matzo meal base, eggs, and a variety of very finely chopped vegetables including onion, zucchini, broccoli, spinach, carrots, and scallions. The batter is prepared by combining matzo meal, salt, sugar, egg yolks, and water, then folding in stiffly beaten egg whites and the chopped vegetables. The latkes are pan-fried in corn oil until golden brown and served with sour cream.
