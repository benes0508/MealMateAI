This recipe is for **White Balsamic-Jicama Slaw**, a refreshing side dish. It combines shredded napa cabbage, carrots, jicama, green onions, and Granny Smith apples, with dried currants. The slaw is dressed in a tangy and sweet white balsamic vinaigrette made with lime juice, honey, oil, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, minced garlic, and fennel seeds. The ingredients are mixed and then refrigerated for at least an hour before serving. A lighter dressing variation using reduced-fat mayonnaise and yogurt is also provided.
