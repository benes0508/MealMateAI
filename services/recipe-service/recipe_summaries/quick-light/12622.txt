This recipe details how to prepare a whole roast chicken infused with a flavorful gremolata butter (made from butter, parsley, lemon peel, and garlic) spread under the skin and over the bird. Artichoke hearts are roasted alongside, basting in the pan drippings. The dish is finished with a simple pan sauce made from the chicken's juices, additional gremolata butter, and fresh lemon juice, served with the roasted chicken and artichokes.
