This recipe is for **D.I.Y. Ricotta**, a homemade fresh cheese. It involves gently boiling a mixture of whole milk, cream, kosher salt, and lemon juice, then letting it stand for curds to form. The curds are then strained through a cheesecloth-lined sieve to produce ricotta, which can be used in dishes like lasagna or served on toast.
