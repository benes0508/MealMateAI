This recipe is for **Panfried Pressed Poussins**, which are poussins (or Cornish game hens) flattened and cooked under a weighted skillet. The birds are seasoned, pan-fried skin-side down until browned, then flipped and cooked through. The pan is then deglazed with chicken stock to create a sauce, and the halved birds are served with these pan juices.
