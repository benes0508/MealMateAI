Wild Rice with Wild Mushrooms is a savory side dish or pilaf. It features wild rice combined with two types of mushrooms: rehydrated porcini and fresh crimini. The porcini are rehydrated in chicken broth, which is later used as the cooking liquid. The dish involves par-boiling the wild rice, saut√©ing aromatics (onion, carrot, garlic) with herbs and both mushrooms, then simmering everything together until the liquid is absorbed and the dish is moist and flavorful. Porcini and rice can be prepared a day in advance.
