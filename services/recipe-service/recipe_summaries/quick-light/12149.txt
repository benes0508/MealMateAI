This recipe features a whole turkey prepared with an umami-rich miso-butter rub infused with rosemary and garlic, which is massaged under the skin. Lemon and orange quarters are used to stuff the cavity, while decorative lemon and red bell pepper slices are placed beneath the skin. The turkey is oven-roasted in a bag, ensuring a moist result. Pan drippings are then used to create a savory, thickened gravy to accompany the dish.
