This recipe is for a **Turkey Meatball Grinder**, a sandwich featuring homemade turkey meatballs simmered in tomato sauce. Ground turkey is mixed with onion, garlic, and herbs, formed into meatballs, then browned in a skillet. The meatballs are then added to warm tomato sauce and simmered. Finally, three saucy meatballs are spooned into each French or Italian roll, which has its insides pulled out, to create the grinder sandwiches.
