This recipe is for Grapefruit Marmalade with Vanilla and Anise. It involves simmering ruby red grapefruit (peel from one, flesh from both), star anise, and vanilla bean in water until reduced. Sugar is then added, and the mixture is cooked until syrupy. Lemon juice is stirred in at the end before jarring. The marmalade can be made up to two months ahead.
