This recipe for Candied Kumquats involves briefly boiling kumquats, then simmering them in a sugar syrup (with water and salt) until tender and translucent. After cooling in the syrup, they are strained (reserving the syrup) and rolled in additional sugar just before serving. The candied kumquats can be stored chilled in their syrup for up to 3 months.
