This Rack-Roasted Chicken recipe features a brined chicken, fingerling potatoes, and shallots. The chicken is roasted directly on an oven rack above the vegetables, allowing its drippings to flavor them. Cooked at 425°F for 35-45 minutes until the chicken reaches 165°F, the dish is finished by draining juices into the vegetable pan and resting before carving.
