This recipe creates a smooth, savory **Parsnip, Potato, and Turnip Puree**. Root vegetables are sautÃ©ed and simmered in vegetable broth, then pureed with cream cheese and butter. The puree is baked until golden, topped with crispy, butter-toasted panko breadcrumbs and fresh dill. It can be prepared a day ahead.
