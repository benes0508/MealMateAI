These Gingerbread Truffles are a rich, spiced chocolate confection. They feature a ganache made from bittersweet and white chocolate infused with classic gingerbread spices like ginger, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and molasses. A hint of chopped crystallized ginger is mixed into the filling. The chilled truffle balls are then dipped in bittersweet chocolate, followed by a partial dip in white chocolate for a decorative finish, and optionally garnished with more crystallized ginger. Requiring several chilling steps, these truffles are a delightful, festive treat.
