This recipe details a no-churn peanut butter ice cream made by folding melted peanut butter into whipped topping and freezing until solid. It's paired with a homemade hard chocolate shell, created by melting dark chocolate with vegetable oil. The dessert is served with the ice cream topped with the chocolate sauce and salted peanuts, allowing the shell to harden before serving.
