This recipe prepares Poached Sockeye Salmon with a creamy Mustard Herb Sauce. Whole sockeye salmon is cut into thick steaks and gently poached in an aromatic broth with onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, and allspice. After cooking, the fish is carefully deboned and de-skinned. The accompanying sauce combines mayonnaise, sour cream, Dijon and whole grain mustards, fresh dill, tarragon, and lemon zest. The salmon is served at room temperature with the sauce on the side.
