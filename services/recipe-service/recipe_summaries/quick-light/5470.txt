Orange-Scented Bluefish is a grilled bluefish fillet. The fish is brined, then brushed with olive oil and orange zest before being slow-cooked skin-side down over indirect heat on a grill, preferably with fruit or nut wood for smoke. After cooking, it's recommended to remove the skin and underlying bloodline.
