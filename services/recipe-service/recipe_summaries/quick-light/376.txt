This recipe details how to make Crispy Taiwanese Pork Cutlets. Thinly pounded pork loin chops are marinated in a savory-sweet blend of soy sauce, rice vinegar, soy paste, sugar, black pepper, cinnamon, and five-spice powder. The marinated pork is then coated in Chinese sweet potato starch and double-fried until exceptionally crispy and golden brown, then typically served sliced.
