A modern take on Carbonara featuring pasta (spaghetti or linguine), crispy bacon, and fresh corn. The creamy sauce is innovatively made by pur√©eing corn kernels, corn "milk" scraped from cobs, heavy cream, and reserved bacon fat. It's tossed with remaining corn, bacon, Parmesan, and basil for a flavorful, seasonal dish.
