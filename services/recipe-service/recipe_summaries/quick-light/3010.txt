This recipe details a 3-ingredient Cacio e Pepe, a classic pasta dish. It involves making a thick paste from Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and olive oil with cold water. Cooked spaghetti is then vigorously combined with this paste, using reserved pasta cooking water to achieve a creamy, clinging sauce. The dish is served immediately, garnished with extra cheese and pepper.
