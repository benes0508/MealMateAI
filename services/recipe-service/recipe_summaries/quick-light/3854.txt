This recipe details how to make a Derby Mint Julep, a classic bourbon cocktail. It involves preparing a mint simple syrup by simmering fresh mint, sugar, and water, then straining and chilling it. The drink is assembled by layering lightly slapped fresh mint leaves, crushed ice, the prepared mint simple syrup, and bourbon in a julep cup, then stirring and garnishing with mint sprigs. The simple syrup can be made up to five days in advance.
