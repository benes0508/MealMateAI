This recipe for Sheboygan-Style "Brats" involves simmering uncooked bratwursts in a mixture of beer, mustard, ketchup, and sliced onion. The brats are then removed and grilled with additional sliced onions until golden brown. They are served on buttered hard rolls, topped with the grilled onions, dill pickles, and Bavarian mustard.
