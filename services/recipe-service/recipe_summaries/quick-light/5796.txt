A classic Spanish sauce, Romesco Sauce is made by blending roasted red bell peppers, garlic, toasted almonds, and tomato pur√©e, flavored with sherry vinegar, smoked paprika, and a touch of cayenne. It's prepared by pulsing ingredients in a food processor with olive oil until smooth. This versatile sauce can be made up to a week in advance.
