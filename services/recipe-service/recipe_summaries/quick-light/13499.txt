Spanakopita is a savory Greek pastry featuring a spinach and feta cheese filling encased in flaky phyllo dough. The spinach is cooked and drained, then mixed with crumbled feta, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Phyllo sheets are brushed with melted butter, cut into strips, and folded around a spoonful of the filling to form triangles. These are baked until golden brown.
