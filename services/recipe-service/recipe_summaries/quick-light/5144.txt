This recipe details how to deep-fry a whole turkey (12-14 lbs) using a specialized turkey frying kit and large quantities of peanut or canola oil. The turkey is seasoned with an aromatic herb rub (thyme, rosemary, paprika, salt, pepper) applied both under and on the skin. The process emphasizes safety, requiring precise oil measurement, heating the oil to 375°F (then maintaining 350°F), and a slow, careful lowering of the bird. Frying time is approximately 3.5 minutes per pound, with a target internal temperature of 165°F, followed by a resting period.
