This recipe details **Stuffed Tortillas with Two Sauces**, a dish featuring soft-fried corn tortillas filled with a savory mixture of hard-boiled eggs and zucchini. It's accompanied by two distinct sauces: a spicy roasted tomato and habanero sauce, and a creamy, earthy pumpkin seed (pipian) sauce. The tortillas are dipped in the pumpkin seed sauce, filled, rolled, baked until heated through, then topped with more pumpkin seed sauce and served with the tomato sauce on the side.
