This recipe details how to prepare **Veal Rolls Stuffed with Spinach and Gruyère**. Veal cutlets are pounded thin, spread with anchovy butter, topped with Gruyère and spinach, then rolled up. The rolls are pan-seared until golden, then finished by baking in the oven. A simple pan sauce is made from deglazing the skillet with white wine, incorporating remaining butter and parsley.
