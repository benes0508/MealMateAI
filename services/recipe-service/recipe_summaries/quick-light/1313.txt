This recipe is for **Hot Honey Pork Chops with Escarole and White Beans**. Bone-in pork chops are seared until golden, then coated in a hot honey sauce made with garlic, honey, apple cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Separately, white beans are warmed in the same skillet with the sauce, oil, vinegar, and seasoning, then tossed with fresh escarole to slightly wilt it. The sauced pork chops are served alongside the warm bean and escarole mixture.
