This recipe features a creamy parsnip purée topped with sautéed Brussels sprouts leaves. Parsnips are boiled until tender, then blended with butter and milk for a smooth purée. Separately, Brussels sprout leaves are sautéed in olive oil until browned and slightly wilted, then seasoned and scattered over the warm parsnip purée.
