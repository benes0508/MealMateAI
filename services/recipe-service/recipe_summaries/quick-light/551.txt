This recipe for "Speedy Skillet Ravioli Lasagna" is a quick, oven-finished skillet dish. It features frozen cheese ravioli simmered in a rich tomato sauce with garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes. Once the ravioli are tender and the sauce is thickened, the dish is layered with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese directly in the skillet, then baked until bubbly and browned for a comforting, lasagna-like meal.
