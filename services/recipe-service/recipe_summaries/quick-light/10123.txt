Assorted baby vegetables, such as potatoes and carrots, are steamed until tender, then quickly marinated in a warm, tangy dressing made with olive oil, champagne vinegar, bay leaves, fennel, oregano, and crushed red pepper. The dish is ready to serve warm or at room temperature after just 15 minutes.
