This recipe details how to make Early Girl Tomato Marmalade. It involves first simmering lemon and orange slices until tender, then blanching and peeling Early Girl tomatoes. These fruits are combined with white sugar, fresh lemon juice, and saffron, then refrigerated overnight. The mixture is subsequently boiled rapidly with a cinnamon stick until it reaches a thick, gelled consistency, tested for proper setting. Finally, the marmalade is skimmed, the cinnamon stick removed, and poured into sterilized jars for storage.
