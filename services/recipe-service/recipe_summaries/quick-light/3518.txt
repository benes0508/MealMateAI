This Chicken Paprikash recipe involves browning seasoned chicken pieces, then saut√©ing onions and two types of paprika (sweet Hungarian, hot smoked Spanish) in the same skillet. Chicken broth is added, and the chicken is returned to the skillet for oven baking until cooked through. Finally, the skillet liquid is reduced, and room temperature sour cream and lemon juice are whisked in to create a creamy sauce to serve over the chicken, garnished with fresh parsley.
