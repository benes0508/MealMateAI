This recipe details how to prepare a Pineapple-Glazed Ham, using either bone-in or boneless cured ham. The ham is first slow-baked wrapped in foil with pineapple and orange slices. Concurrently, a glaze is made from pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce. After an initial bake, the ham is unwrapped, basted with the warm glaze, and returned to a hotter oven to caramelize the glaze. It's served with the roasted fruit and maraschino cherries.
