Crispy Fried Shallots involves thinly slicing shallots and slow-frying them in vegetable oil until golden brown and crispy (20-25 minutes). After draining, they are seasoned with salt and cooled. The aromatic shallot oil can be reserved for other uses, and the fried shallots can be stored airtight for up to 5 days.
