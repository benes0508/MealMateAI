This recipe is for Lebanese Lamb and Bean Stew (Loubia Bi Lahme). It features lamb shoulder and dried navy beans simmered in water with baharat (or cinnamon) until tender. A separate mixture of sautÃ©ed onions, garlic, and tomato paste is then stirred in, and the stew is seasoned with salt and pepper. It's traditionally served with spiced basmati rice or pita bread.
