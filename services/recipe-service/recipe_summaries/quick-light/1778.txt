This recipe guides you through making homemade nut butter using about 280g of shelled raw nuts. The process involves toasting the nuts at 300°F (180°C) for 20-30 minutes until fragrant and golden. After cooling, the nuts are processed in a food processor, transforming from a powder into a smooth, creamy butter as their natural oils release, with no added oil required. The finished nut butter stores well in the refrigerator for up to one month.
