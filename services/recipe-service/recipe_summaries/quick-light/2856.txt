This recipe is for a savory compound butter featuring charred spring onions, red pepper flakes, and shichimi togarashi (a Japanese seven-spice blend). Spring onions are grilled until lightly charred and wilted, then finely chopped and mixed into softened butter with the spices. The resulting sesame-chile butter can be prepared a week in advance and is ideal for adding flavor to various dishes.
