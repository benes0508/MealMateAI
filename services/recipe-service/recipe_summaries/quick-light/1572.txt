This Instant Pot recipe features boneless pork chops paired with Granny Smith apples and a fragrant sauce flavored with cinnamon, sage, and pumpkin pie spice. The chops are first browned, then pressure-cooked with the apples and spices in an applesauce and water base. The cooking liquid is then reduced to create a thickened sauce served over the finished pork and apples.
