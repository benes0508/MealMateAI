This recipe details a Mussel Soup with Avocado, Tomato, and Dill. It involves saut√©ing leeks with thyme, then steaming mussels in a lager and water broth. The cooked mussels are shelled and set aside, while the broth is strained, enriched with half-and-half, and seasoned. The soup is then assembled by combining the mussels with the hot broth, topped with a fresh mixture of diced avocado, halved grape tomatoes, and chopped dill before serving.
