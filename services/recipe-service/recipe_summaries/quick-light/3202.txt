This recipe features **Roast Chicken With Harissa And Schmaltz**. A whole chicken (halved and partially deboned) is first brined for 12 hours in a mixture of water, salt, sugar, garlic, and coriander. It's then coated in harissa and chilled again. The chicken is pan-seared skin-side down in schmaltz (chicken fat) until crispy, then roasted in the oven at 400°F (initially skin-side down, then flipped) until cooked through (165°F in the thigh). Serve drizzled with the cooking schmaltz.
