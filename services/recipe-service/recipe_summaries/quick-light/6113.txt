This recipe features Coconut-Corn Ice Cream served with a spiced brown-sugar syrup and garnished with peanuts and lime zest. The ice cream base is made by steeping grated corn and cobs in a mixture of unsweetened coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk, then straining, chilling, and churning. A separate brown-sugar syrup is prepared by simmering sugar with toasted coriander seeds, black peppercorns, and salt, then straining and chilling. The finished ice cream is served with a drizzle of the syrup and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts and lime zest.
