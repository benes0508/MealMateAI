This recipe details how to make crispy fried shallots by double-frying thinly sliced shallots in canola oil. First, fry until light golden brown at 275°F, then briefly fry again at 350°F until crispy and well-browned, draining immediately. The infused oil can be reserved for other uses. Best enjoyed fresh.
