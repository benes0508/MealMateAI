Grilled Oregano Chicken features chicken marinated for 4-12 hours in an aromatic blend of anchovies, garlic, onion, chopped oregano, olive oil, and lemon juice. The chicken is then grilled until lightly charred and cooked through. It's served atop a base of tomatoes in chile-fennel oil and finished with a vibrant, fresh anchovy-olive-lemon zest mixture and additional oregano leaves.
