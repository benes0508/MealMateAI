This recipe is for Espagnole Sauce, a classic French "mother sauce." It involves sautéing a mirepoix (carrot, onion, celery) in butter, then forming a medium brown roux with flour. Hot beef stock (or demi-glace), tomato purée, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaf are added. The sauce is then simmered for about 45 minutes until reduced, and finally strained to remove solids, resulting in a smooth, rich brown sauce.
