This recipe details how to make "Flaky Bread," a thin, pan-fried bread. It involves preparing a soft dough with flour, water, and melted butter, which is then rested, divided, and rolled into very thin rounds. These rounds are brushed with butter, coiled, then re-rolled extremely thin before being cooked on a hot cast-iron griddle until lightly blistered and cooked through. The finished bread is sprinkled with flaky sea salt. Coils can be prepared and frozen up to a month ahead.
