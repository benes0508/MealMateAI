Mujadara is a comforting vegetarian dish centered on a hearty blend of brown/green lentils and long-grain white rice. Its signature element is the generous use of onions, which are caramelized in two stages: half are cooked into the lentil-rice mixture, while the remaining half are deeply browned until crisp to serve as a flavorful topping. The dish is seasoned with salt and pepper and can be served hot or at room temperature, optionally with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream.
