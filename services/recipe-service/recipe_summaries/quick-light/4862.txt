Angry Shrimp features medium-large shrimp coated in a unique, rich sauce. This sauce blends sweet and fruity notes from pureed golden raisins, dried cherries, and Grand Marnier orange liqueur with a spicy, smoky kick from chipotle powder, garlic, and cumin. The dish is served alongside saut√©ed kale and brown rice, garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds for texture.
