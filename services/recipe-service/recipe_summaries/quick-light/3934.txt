This recipe is for a **Ragout of Lamb and Spring Vegetables with Farro**. It features lamb shoulder browned and then slow-simmered with pearl onions, garlic, balsamic vinegar, red wine, and chicken broth, along with an herb bundle (oregano, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves). Farro is added later to cook until al dente, followed by baby turnips, asparagus, peas, and dandelion greens for a final wilt, resulting in a hearty, tender stew.
