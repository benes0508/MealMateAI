This recipe details how to make Greek Yogurt Labneh by first draining Greek yogurt in cheesecloth for 2-3 days until it becomes thick and cheese-like. The thickened yogurt is then rolled into balls and marinated in a mixture of extra virgin olive oil, fresh herbs (tarragon, parsley, chives), lemon zest, salt, and pepper for at least 8 hours.
