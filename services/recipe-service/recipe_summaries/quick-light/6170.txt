This recipe is for **Clinched Double-Wide Loin Lamb Chops**, a grilled dish using thick English-cut lamb chops. Key steps involve seasoning the chops to create a "meat paste," grilling them over a very hot coal fire (3 minutes per side, basting with butter), then using a foil-wrapped brick to lean and cook the chops fat-side down until they reach 120Â°F internal temperature. Finally, the cooked chops are coated in a pre-made board dressing before serving.
