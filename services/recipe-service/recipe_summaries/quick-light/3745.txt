This recipe details how to prepare a **Lime-and-Cilantro-Stuffed Black Bass**. A whole black bass (or branzino) is seasoned with salt and pepper, then stuffed with fresh cilantro and thinly sliced lime before being tied with kitchen twine. The fish is then grilled until the skin is charred and crisp, and the flesh is flaky and opaque on both sides (6-10 minutes per side). It is served on a platter lined with the remaining cilantro and lime slices.
