This recipe describes how to make Basil Ice Cream. It involves steeping fresh basil in a hot milk and sugar mixture, blending it, then tempering it with egg yolks to form a custard. The custard is cooked to 175Â°F, rapidly chilled, combined with heavy cream, and finally churned in an ice cream maker before being frozen to harden.
