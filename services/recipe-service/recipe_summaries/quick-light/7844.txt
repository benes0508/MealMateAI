This recipe is for a **Wild Garlic and White Bean Curry**, a fragrant and flavorful dish. It combines toasted and ground spices (coriander, mustard, fenugreek, cardamom, chili, curry leaves, kaffir lime) with red onions, garlic, cilantro roots, tomatoes, and coconut milk. White beans (coco or cannellini) provide substance, while the unique wild garlic is stirred in just before serving to maintain its bright flavor. The curry is balanced with jaggery/sugar, lime juice, and fish sauce, resulting in a profile that is "soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you."
