This Apricot-Cherry Trifle recipe creates individual layered desserts. It involves gently cooking apricots with lemon juice, apricot nectar, and vanilla, then pureeing and combining them with plain yogurt. Angel food cake circles are layered in glasses with this apricot-yogurt mixture and fresh Bing cherry halves, topped with more cherries and a drizzle.
