This recipe details how to prepare **Roasted Chicken with Garlic Confit**. A 3lb chicken, quartered, is seasoned with salt, pepper, butter, and olive oil, then roasted at a high temperature (500Â°F). Separately, garlic cloves are confited with thyme in olive oil until very tender. After an initial roast, the chicken is topped with mashed garlic confit and returned to the oven to finish cooking, resulting in crisp skin and tender, flavorful chicken.
