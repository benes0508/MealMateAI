This recipe for Turnips with Bacon and Pickled Mustard Seeds starts by preparing a tangy mixture of pickled yellow mustard seeds. Crispy bacon is cooked and then combined with these pickled seeds and whole grain mustard to create a savory-tangy vinaigrette. Finally, tender boiled baby turnips are tossed warm with this unique bacon-mustard dressing and seasoned.
