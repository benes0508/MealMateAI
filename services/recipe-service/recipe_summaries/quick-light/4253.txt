This recipe is for a **skillet-cooked pizza** using a master dough base. The dough is rolled thin and cooked in a hot cast-iron skillet until golden, then topped with mozzarella cheese while still in the pan. Once cooked, it's finished with raw toppings including thinly shaved lardo, squacquerone cheese, prosciutto cotto, and shaved pecorino romano.
