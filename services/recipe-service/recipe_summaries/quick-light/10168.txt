This recipe features olive-oil-poached shrimp served over a vibrant "Winter Pistou." The pistou is a smooth, savory sauce made by blending blanched basil, cooked carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cranberry beans, parsley, vegetable stock, and olive oil. Shrimp are gently poached in olive oil infused with thyme until tender. The dish is served with the warm pistou as a base, topped with the poached shrimp.
