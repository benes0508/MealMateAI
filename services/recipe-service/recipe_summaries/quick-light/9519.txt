This recipe details how to make crispy Plantain Chips by deep-frying thinly sliced green plantains. Green plantains are peeled, sliced very thin (less than 1/16 inch), and fried in batches in 375Â°F oil until golden, about 1 minute per batch. The chips are drained on paper towels and immediately seasoned with salt.
