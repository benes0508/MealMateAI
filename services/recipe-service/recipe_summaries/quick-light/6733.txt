This recipe guides you through making a Rich and Silky Turkey Gravy. It starts with a classic roux (made from butter/turkey fat and flour) thickened with homemade or store-bought turkey stock. Optional enhancements for depth include bay leaves or thyme, dried porcini mushrooms or powder, and Madeira. The gravy is simmered for reduction, then enriched by incorporating strained, deglazed turkey pan drippings for ultimate flavor and richness.
