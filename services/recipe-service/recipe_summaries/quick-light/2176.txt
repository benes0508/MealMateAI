This recipe describes how to make Gluten-Free Sticky Rice Buns. White sushi rice is cooked for optimal stickiness, then mixed with scallions and sesame seeds. The mixture is formed into 8 flat, round patties which are pan-fried until golden brown. These versatile buns are gluten-free and can be prepared ahead of time.
