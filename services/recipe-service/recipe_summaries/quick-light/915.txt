This recipe features parsnip confit, made by slow-roasting parsnips with garlic, ginger, rosemary, and salt in olive oil until tender, then pan-searing them for a golden, charred finish. It's served with a vibrant pickled currant sauce, prepared by simmering currants with sugar, apple cider vinegar, and Aleppo pepper. The dish is garnished with the roasted garlic and fresh rosemary.
