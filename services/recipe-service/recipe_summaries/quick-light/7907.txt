This recipe features pan-seared and roasted branzino (or striped bass) fillets, accompanied by roasted baby vegetables. A fragrant tarragon-chive oil, made with fresh tarragon, Italian parsley, and chives, is prepared and used to drizzle over both the fish and vegetables, enhancing their flavor. The fish is initially seared skin-side down, then finished in the oven.
