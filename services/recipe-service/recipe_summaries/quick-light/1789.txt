This recipe provides detailed instructions for making Caramelized Onions, using yellow onions, unsalted butter, and salt. The process involves thinly slicing a large quantity of onions and slow-cooking them in butter over medium-low heat. The recipe provides stages for different doneness levels: blonde (for French onion soup), golden brown (for patty melts/dips), and extra-dark (for burger toppings). Emphasis is placed on proper slicing, gradual addition of onions, frequent stirring, and optional deglazing with broth/water to prevent sticking and deepen flavor over the long cooking time. The finished caramelized onions can be stored for up to a week.
