This recipe details how to prepare Veal Osso Buco, a classic Italian dish. Veal shanks are first salted, rinsed, and tied, then dredged in flour and seared until browned. They are then slow-braised in an oven for 2.5 hours in a rich liquid made from saut√©ed carrots, celery, onion, garlic, red wine, veal or chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, and a bay leaf, until the meat is fork-tender. The braising liquid is strained and reduced to create a flavorful sauce. The dish is served with the sauce and garnished with fresh horseradish, lemon zest, and chopped parsley.
