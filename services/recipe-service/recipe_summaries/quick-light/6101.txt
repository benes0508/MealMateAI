This recipe creates a rich creamed corn, achieving its creamy texture by puréeing half of the corn kernels with their natural juices instead of traditional dairy cream. It's built on a base of sautéed onion and garlic, then combined with both puréed and whole corn. The dish is uniquely finished with a fragrant drizzle of butter infused with a homemade, freshly ground garam masala blend, offering a complex, aromatic, Indian-inspired flavor.
