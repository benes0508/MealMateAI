This recipe prepares a classic **Pasta Carbonara with English Peas**. It features pasta (fettuccine, linguine, or spaghetti), crispy pancetta, and a creamy sauce made from rendered pancetta fat emulsified with pasta water, whisked into a tempered egg, and combined with grated Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano cheeses. Fresh English peas and scallions are added for brightness. The dish is tossed quickly until coated in the rich, creamy sauce and served immediately.
