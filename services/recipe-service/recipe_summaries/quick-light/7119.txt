Cacio e Pepe is a classic Roman pasta dish featuring pasta, butter, freshly cracked black pepper, Grana Padano (or Parmesan), and Pecorino cheese. The recipe involves toasting pepper in butter, then emulsifying it with reserved pasta water, cooked pasta, and the cheeses to create a creamy, al dente sauce.
