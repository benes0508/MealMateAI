A vibrant slaw featuring julienned carrots, thinly sliced Savoy cabbage, and chopped carrot fronds. It's dressed with a savory-sweet cumin vinaigrette made from sherry vinegar, dark brown sugar, and toasted cumin seeds. The ingredients are tossed together and allowed to stand for 30 minutes before serving, allowing flavors to meld.
