This recipe features roasted salmon and broccoli, seasoned simply with salt and pepper, cooked on a single baking sheet. It's served with a vibrant and zesty chile-caper vinaigrette made from thinly sliced jalape√±o, rice vinegar, capers, and olive oil, adding a bright, tangy, and slightly spicy finish.
