This recipe details how to make Onigiri, Japanese rice balls. The primary method involves shaping warm, salted rice into triangles around a filling of cooked salmon, then wrapping the base with nori. A variation, "Yaki Onigiri," is also provided, which are plain rice balls brushed with soy or miso and broiled until crispy, without filling or nori.
