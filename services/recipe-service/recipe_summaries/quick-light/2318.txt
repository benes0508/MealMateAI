This recipe details how to make **Black-and-White Halvah**, a sweet confection. It involves separately preparing two batches—one with white tahini and one with black tahini—by mixing each with hot sugar syrup boiled to 248°F in a stand mixer. The distinct white and black halvah masses are then combined, folded, and flattened to create a marbled effect before being pressed into a loaf pan, cooled, and sliced. The halvah can be made up to three days in advance and stored at room temperature.
