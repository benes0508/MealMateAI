This recipe creates "tacos" using savory chickpea flour crêpes as the shell. The filling is a rich, simmered mixture of ground lamb, sautéed eggplant, garlic, golden raisins, red wine, diced tomatoes, and pine nuts, seasoned with cumin and red pepper flakes. The completed crêpe tacos are topped with plain yogurt and baby greens, served with lemon wedges. Both the crêpe batter and cooked crêpes can be prepared in advance.
