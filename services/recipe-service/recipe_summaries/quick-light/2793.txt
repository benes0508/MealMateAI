A velvety, dairy-free pea soup featuring deeply caramelized onions, celery, and garlic. Raw cashews provide a rich, creamy base, blended with sugar snap peas and strained for an exceptionally smooth, pourable texture. Its flavor is balanced with a touch of sugar and brightened by malt vinegar. Uniquely garnished with scallions and crushed potato chips, this plant-based soup can be made ahead.
