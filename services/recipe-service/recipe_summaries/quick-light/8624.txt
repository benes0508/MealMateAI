This recipe for **Sticky Balsamic Ribs** features pork ribs marinated for 8-24 hours in a sweet and tangy blend of balsamic vinegar, dark brown sugar, garlic, rosemary, and cayenne. The ribs are slow-roasted until very tender, then glazed and finished on the grill for a sticky, caramelized exterior. The pan drippings are reduced to create an additional serving glaze.
