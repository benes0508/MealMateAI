This recipe details how to make a Spinach, Pesto, and Fontina Lasagna. It involves preparing a **white cheese sauce** (Parmesan, milk, wine), a **spinach filling** (saut√©ed spinach reduced with its own liquid, mixed with sauce), and a **ricotta mixture** (ricotta, Parmesan, lemon peel, egg). The lasagna is assembled in layers using **no-boil noodles**, alternating with the spinach, ricotta, and pesto, topped with Fontina cheese. It's then baked until bubbling and finished under a broiler for a golden-brown top.
