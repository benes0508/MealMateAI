This recipe details making homemade asparagus ravioli in a light Parmesan sauce. Asparagus stems are cooked in chicken stock with Parmesan rind and a bay leaf, then pur√©ed with grated Parmesan, mascarpone, breadcrumbs, and lemon zest for the filling. Homemade pasta dough is rolled thin, filled with the asparagus mixture, shaped into ravioli, and boiled. The reserved asparagus broth is seasoned and simmered with the reserved asparagus tips to create a light sauce, which is served with the cooked ravioli.
