This recipe is for **Crab Rangoon**, a deep-fried appetizer featuring a creamy filling of lump crab meat, cream cheese, green onion, and tarragon, seasoned with salt and pepper. The filling is wrapped in square wonton skins (often in a triangle, purse, or tortellini shape), then deep-fried until golden brown. They can be made ahead and frozen. Serve with sweet chili or plum sauce.
