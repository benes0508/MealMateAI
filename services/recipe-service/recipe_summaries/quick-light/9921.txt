This recipe details how to make **Strawberry Leather** using fresh strawberries and sugar. The process involves puréeing the fruit, simmering it until thick and reduced, spreading it thinly onto a nonstick liner, and then drying it in a low-temperature oven (200°F) for 2-3 hours. After cooling completely, the leather is peeled off and rolled up with parchment paper for storage.
