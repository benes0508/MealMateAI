This Lamb Larb is a flavorful Thai-inspired dish featuring ground lamb seared until crisp, then mixed with a fragrant saut√©ed aromatic paste of lemongrass, garlic, shallot, cilantro stems, and Thai chiles. It's tossed with a lime-fish sauce dressing and crushed peanuts, and typically served with white rice, bibb lettuce cups, cucumber, fresh lime, mint, and cilantro.
