This recipe prepares **Pasta with Delicata Squash and Sage-Brown Butter**. It involves browning butter until nutty, then frying sage leaves until crispy. Delicata squash is cooked in some of the brown butter until tender and caramelized. Separately, pasta is cooked al dente. Finally, the pasta is tossed with the squash, remaining brown butter, and a bit of pasta water to create a light sauce. The dish is finished with a topping of toasted panko breadcrumbs, crispy sage, and shaved Parmesan.
