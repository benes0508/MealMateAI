This recipe details how to prepare a luxurious version of soft scrambled eggs, infused with cognac and butter, cooked gently on and off the heat for a creamy texture, and finished with sour cream or labneh. The rich eggs are then generously topped with caviar or roe and served on toasted sourdough or pumpernickel rye bread.
