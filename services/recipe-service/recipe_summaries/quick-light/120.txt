Shaak-no Sambharo is an Indian-inspired quick pickled vegetable condiment. It features mixed vegetables (e.g., cauliflower, carrots, radish) briefly cooked in an aromatic oil infused with mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, asafetida, cayenne, and ginger, balanced with white vinegar and salt. This no-fermentation pickle is ready immediately and stored in the refrigerator.
