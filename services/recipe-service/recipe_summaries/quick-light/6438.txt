Chilaquiles with Fried Eggs is a Mexican dish featuring homemade red chile sauce (from rehydrated guajillo chiles, tomatoes, and aromatics) simmered until thickened. Corn tortillas are fried until crisp, then tossed with the sauce, layered with Monterey Jack and queso fresco, and broiled until the cheese melts. It's served topped with a fried egg, diced onion, radishes, cilantro, and lime wedges.
