This recipe for **Rack of Lamb with Garlic and Herbs** details preparing two frenched lamb racks. The lamb is first seasoned with salt and pepper, then seared in a hot skillet until browned. A mixture of minced garlic, fresh parsley, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, and olive oil is applied to the meaty parts. The lamb is then roasted in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes, followed by an additional 5-10 minutes (covered loosely with foil) until an internal temperature of 120°F is reached. After resting for 10 minutes (reaching 125-130°F for medium-rare), each rack is cut into four double chops.
