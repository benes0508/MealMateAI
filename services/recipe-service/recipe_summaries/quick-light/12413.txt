This recipe details how to make **Pickled Peaches** using a water bath canning method for preservation. It involves blanching, peeling, halving, and pitting peaches, then chilling them overnight with sugar to extract juices. The peaches are then simmered with distilled white vinegar, pickling spice, and salt until tender. Finally, they are packed into sterilized jars, covered with the hot pickling liquid, and processed in a boiling water canner for 20 minutes to ensure a shelf-stable seal for up to 6 months.
