A Japanese-inspired pasta dish featuring spaghettini coated in a rich butter and mentaiko (fish roe) dressing. It's simply prepared by combining the cooked pasta with the creamy dressing, then garnished with shredded nori seaweed, shiso leaves (or basil/mint), and green onions, seasoned with kombu cha powder and soy sauce.
