A simple and delicious side dish, this Creamy Corn with Chives recipe uniquely achieves its velvety texture by puréeing fresh corn kernels and their natural juices, rather than using dairy. Sautéed with onion and butter, the dish is simmered until thick and comforting, then finished with fresh chives for a bright, savory flavor.
