🍞 Classic French Toast
Ingredients (serves 2–3):
4–6 slices of bread (preferably slightly stale or thick-cut like brioche, challah, or Texas toast)

2 large eggs

1/2 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

1 tablespoon sugar (optional)

Pinch of salt

Butter or oil for frying

Toppings (optional): Maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh berries, banana slices, whipped cream

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Make the custard:
In a shallow bowl or pie dish, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, and salt until well combined.

2. Dip the bread:
Dip each slice of bread into the mixture for a few seconds per side, ensuring it’s coated but not soggy.

3. Cook the toast:
Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat and melt a bit of butter or oil.

Place dipped bread slices on the skillet and cook for 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

4. Serve:
Serve warm with your favorite toppings like maple syrup, berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Crispier edges: Use a bit more butter in the pan and let the edges brown slightly.

Stuffed French toast: Add cream cheese or Nutella between two slices before dipping.

Dairy-free: Use almond, oat, or soy milk, and cook with oil or dairy-free butter.

Make ahead: French toast freezes well — cool completely, then freeze and reheat in a toaster or oven.
