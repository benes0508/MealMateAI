Classic Sushi Roll (Maki)
Ingredients (makes 4 rolls):
2 cups sushi rice (short-grain rice)

2 ¬Ω cups water (for cooking the rice)

2 tbsp rice vinegar

1 tbsp sugar

¬Ω tsp salt

4 sheets of nori (seaweed)

1 cucumber, julienned

1 avocado, sliced

200 g (7 oz) sushi-grade raw fish (such as tuna, salmon, or shrimp) ‚Äî optional

Soy sauce, for serving

Pickled ginger, for serving

Wasabi, for serving

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
Cook the sushi rice:

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.

Cook the rice in a rice cooker or on the stovetop with 2 ¬Ω cups of water. Once cooked, let it sit for 10 minutes to firm up.

Season the rice:

While the rice is cooling, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved.

Once the rice has cooled to room temperature, gently fold the vinegar mixture into the rice using a wooden spoon or rice paddle. Set aside.

Prepare your ingredients:

Slice the cucumber, avocado, and fish into long, thin strips.

Assemble the sushi rolls:

Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat (or a clean kitchen towel) with the shiny side facing down.

Wet your hands with a little water to prevent the rice from sticking.

Spread a thin, even layer of sushi rice (about ¬æ cup) over the nori, leaving about 1 inch at the top free of rice.

Lay your fillings (cucumber, avocado, fish) in a line across the center of the rice.

Roll the sushi:

Carefully lift the edge of the mat closest to you and roll it away from you, keeping the fillings in place.

Roll tightly but not too tight, sealing the edge with a little water on the exposed nori.

Cut the rolls:

Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into 6‚Äì8 pieces. Wet the knife between cuts to keep it clean.

Serve:

Arrange the sushi rolls on a plate and serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Vegetarian options: Swap out fish for other fillings like cucumber, avocado, carrots, or tofu.

For a crunchy texture: Add a few sprinkles of toasted sesame seeds or tempura flakes.

Spicy mayo: Mix mayo with a bit of sriracha to drizzle on top for extra flavor.
