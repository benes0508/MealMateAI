Guacamole with Chips
Ingredients (serves 4):
For the Guacamole:

3 ripe avocados, peeled, pitted, and mashed

1/2 small red onion, finely chopped

1 small tomato, diced

1 garlic clove, minced

1 lime (juiced)

1/2 tsp ground cumin (optional)

1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for a bit of heat)

Salt and pepper, to taste

1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)

For the Chips:

1 bag of tortilla chips (store-bought or homemade)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Make the guacamole:
In a medium bowl, mash the avocados using a fork or potato masher until smooth but still chunky.

Add the chopped red onion, diced tomato, minced garlic, and lime juice to the mashed avocado.

Stir in the cumin and chili powder (if using), and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Mix in the cilantro if you like the fresh flavor, or leave it out if you prefer a more traditional guacamole.

2. Serve the chips:
Pour the tortilla chips into a large serving bowl or spread them on a plate.

3. Serve the guacamole:
Transfer the guacamole to a small serving bowl.

Serve immediately with the tortilla chips for dipping.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Add heat: For spicy guacamole, add some finely chopped jalape√±o or a dash of hot sauce.

Tomato options: If you prefer a less watery guacamole, you can remove the seeds from the tomato before chopping.

Homemade chips: If you want to make your own chips, cut corn tortillas into wedges, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and bake at 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) for 10-15 minutes until crispy.
