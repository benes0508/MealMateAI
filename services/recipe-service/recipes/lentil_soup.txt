6 cups vegetable broth (or chicken broth)

1 tsp cumin

1 tsp ground turmeric (optional)

½ tsp ground coriander

½ tsp smoked paprika (optional for a smoky flavor)

Salt & pepper, to taste

2 cups spinach or kale (optional, for greens)

Juice of ½ lemon (for brightness, optional)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
Sauté the vegetables:

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Add onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5–7 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.

Add garlic and spices:

Stir in garlic, cumin, turmeric, coriander, and paprika (if using). Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

Add lentils and liquid:

Add rinsed lentils, diced tomatoes, and broth. Stir well to combine.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30–40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.

Finish the soup:

Once the lentils are tender, add salt, pepper, and lemon juice (if using).

Stir in spinach or kale if desired, and cook for an additional 5–7 minutes until wilted.

Serve hot, and enjoy!

📝 Tips & Variations:
Add extra veggies: Bell peppers, zucchini, or tomatoes work well in this soup.

For a smoother texture, use an immersion blender to blend part of the soup or all of it.

Add protein: You can add cooked chicken or sausage for extra protein, or mix in a can of beans.

Make it spicier: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes or some diced jalapeño for heat.
