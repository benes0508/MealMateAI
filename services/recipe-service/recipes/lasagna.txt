Classic Beef Lasagna
Ingredients (serves 6–8):
For the meat sauce:

2 tbsp olive oil

1 onion, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, minced

500 g (1 lb) ground beef (or beef/pork mix)

2 tbsp tomato paste

1 can (400 g / 14 oz) crushed tomatoes

½ cup beef broth or red wine (optional)

1 tsp dried oregano

Salt & pepper, to taste

For the cheese mixture:

1 ½ cups ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese)

1 egg

½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Salt & pepper, to taste

Other layers:

9–12 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)

2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Fresh basil or parsley (optional, for garnish)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
Cook the meat sauce:

Heat olive oil in a pan. Sauté onion and garlic until soft.

Add ground beef and cook until browned.

Stir in tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, oregano, and broth/wine.

Simmer uncovered for 20–30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Mix the ricotta filling:

In a bowl, combine ricotta, egg, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.

Cook noodles (if needed):

Boil lasagna noodles in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.

Assemble the lasagna (in a 9x13 inch / 22x33 cm baking dish):

Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.

Add a layer of noodles.

Spread ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, a layer of meat sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella.

Repeat layers (typically 3 total), ending with meat sauce and mozzarella on top.

Bake:

Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes.

Uncover and bake another 15–20 minutes until bubbly and golden.

Rest, then serve:

Let lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.

🔄 Optional Additions:
Add spinach or zucchini to the ricotta mixture.

Make it vegetarian by skipping meat and adding sautéed veggies.

Use béchamel instead of ricotta for an Italian-style white sauce version.
