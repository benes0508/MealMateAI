youâ€™ll need 3 simple ingredients:

Water
Old fashioned oats
Salt

Combine the water, oats, and salt in a deep, microwave-safe bowl.
Microwave for 90 seconds, then remove the oats from the microwave and stir.
Microwave for another 30 seconds to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until the oats have absorbed most of the water. The exact timing will depend on your microwave and oats. Keep an eye on the oats in the microwave. They puff up as they cook and can easily overflow!
Let stand for a minute before serving.
