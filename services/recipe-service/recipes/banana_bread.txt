Classic Banana Bread
Ingredients (makes 1 loaf):
2-3 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/2 cups)

1/3 cup melted butter

1 teaspoon baking soda

Pinch of salt

3/4 cup sugar (can reduce to 1/2 cup for less sweetness)

1 large egg, beaten

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Optional: 1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts, pecans) or chocolate chips

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 4x8-inch loaf pan with butter or line it with parchment paper.

2. Prepare the wet ingredients:
In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork or potato masher until smooth, leaving a few small lumps for texture if you like.

Stir in the melted butter until well combined.

3. Add the rest of the ingredients:
Mix in the baking soda, salt, sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.

Add the flour and stir until just incorporated (don't overmix). If you're adding nuts or chocolate chips, fold them in gently at this point.

4. Pour and bake:
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

Bake in the preheated oven for 60-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

5. Cool and serve:
Let the banana bread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

Slice and enjoy your delicious, homemade banana bread!

📝 Tips & Variations:
Riper bananas: The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your banana bread will be, so it's a perfect recipe to use up overripe bananas!

Vegan option: Replace the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 2.5 tbsp water) and use a non-dairy butter or oil.

Flour options: You can substitute up to half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for a heartier version.

Add-ins: Add a handful of dried fruit (raisins, cranberries) or shredded coconut for extra flavor and texture.
