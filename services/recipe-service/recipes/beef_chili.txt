Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Add garlic and sauté 1 more minute.

Brown the beef:

Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon. Drain excess fat if needed.

Add spices and tomato paste:

Stir in chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, pepper, and tomato paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes to bloom spices.

Simmer:

Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.

Adjust seasoning:

Taste and add salt, pepper, or hot sauce as needed.

Serve hot with toppings like shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions, or tortilla chips.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Want a richer flavor? Simmer longer (up to 1 hour).

Use ground turkey or plant-based crumbles for a leaner or vegetarian version.

Add corn, bell pepper, or chopped jalapeño for more texture.
