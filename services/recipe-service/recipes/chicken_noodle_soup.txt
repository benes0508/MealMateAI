Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Optional: a squeeze of lemon for brightness

Add thyme (or seasoning blend), salt, and pepper.

Bring to a boil.

Cook the noodles:

Add noodles and cook according to package instructions (usually 6–8 minutes) until tender.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Use raw chicken (breast or thighs)? Simmer it in the broth for 15–20 minutes, then shred and return to the pot.

Want a creamy version? Add ½ cup cream or a splash of milk at the end.

Gluten-free? Use rice or GF noodles.
