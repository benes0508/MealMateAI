🥞 Classic Fluffy Pancakes
Ingredients (makes about 8 pancakes):
1 cup all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)

1 large egg

2 tablespoons melted butter or oil (plus more for the pan)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Mix dry ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. Mix wet ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla (if using) until combined.

3. Combine:
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir just until combined — don’t overmix; a few lumps are okay!

4. Cook the pancakes:
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.

Pour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the hot pan.

Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set (about 2 minutes), then flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.

5. Serve:
Stack pancakes on a plate and serve warm with maple syrup, fresh fruit, butter, or your favorite toppings.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Buttermilk pancakes: Replace milk with buttermilk and reduce baking powder to 1 tsp; add 1/2 tsp baking soda.

Add-ins: Stir in chocolate chips, blueberries, or chopped bananas before cooking.

Freeze extras: Let leftovers cool completely, freeze in a single layer, then reheat in a toaster or oven.
