Veggie Burger
Ingredients (makes 4 burgers):
For the Patties:

1 can (15 oz) black beans or chickpeas, drained and mashed

1 cup cooked quinoa or rice (for texture)

1/2 cup breadcrumbs (or gluten-free breadcrumbs for a gluten-free version)

1/2 cup grated carrots or zucchini (squeeze out excess moisture from zucchini)

1/4 cup finely chopped onion

2 cloves garlic, minced

1/4 cup fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped

1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari (for a gluten-free version)

1 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp paprika

1/2 tsp ground coriander

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 egg (or flax egg for a vegan version)

1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)

For the Burger Assembly:

4 whole wheat or regular burger buns

Lettuce leaves

Tomato slices

Onion slices

Avocado slices (optional)

Ketchup, mustard, or vegan mayo (optional condiments)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the patties:
In a large bowl, mash the black beans or chickpeas with a fork or potato masher until mostly mashed, leaving some chunks for texture.

Add the cooked quinoa or rice, grated carrots or zucchini, breadcrumbs, onion, garlic, parsley, soy sauce, cumin, paprika, ground coriander, and salt and pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.

Add the egg (or flax egg for vegan) and stir until the mixture is sticky and holds together. If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs until it firms up.

2. Shape the patties:
Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty. Use your hands to form them into rounds about 1/2 inch thick.

3. Cook the patties:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Cook the veggie patties for about 4‚Äì5 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. You can also cook them on a grill if preferred.

4. Toast the buns:
While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns in a dry skillet or oven for 1‚Äì2 minutes until golden brown.

5. Assemble the burgers:
Place the veggie patties on the bottom half of each toasted bun.

Top with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado slices (if using), and any condiments you like (ketchup, mustard, or vegan mayo).

6. Serve:
Place the top half of the bun on the assembled veggie patty and serve immediately with your favorite side dish (fries, salad, or chips).

üìù Tips & Variations:
Grilled veggie burger: For a smoky flavor, grill the patties instead of pan-frying them.

Add extra flavor: Try adding grated cheese (dairy or vegan) into the patty mixture for extra richness.

Make it gluten-free: Use gluten-free breadcrumbs and tamari instead of soy sauce.

Add some heat: If you like spice, add chopped jalape√±os or chili flakes to the mixture.

Vegetable variations: You can swap in other veggies like corn, peas, or spinach depending on what you like.
