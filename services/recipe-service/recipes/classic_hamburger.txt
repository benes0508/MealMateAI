Classic Hamburger
Ingredients (makes 4 burgers):
For the Burger Patties:

1 lb (450 g) ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat for juiciness)

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional, for added flavor)

1 tsp garlic powder (optional)

1 tsp onion powder (optional)

For the Burger Assembly:

4 hamburger buns

Lettuce leaves

1 tomato, sliced

1 onion, sliced into rings

Pickles (optional)

Cheese slices (cheddar, American, Swiss, etc.)

Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (optional condiments)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the patties:
In a large bowl, gently mix the ground beef with Worcestershire sauce (if using), garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the burgers tough.

Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Make them slightly larger than your buns, as they will shrink when cooked.

2. Cook the patties:
Heat a grill, griddle, or large skillet over medium-high heat and lightly oil the surface.

Place the burger patties on the hot grill or skillet and cook for about 4‚Äì5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. For medium, cook the patties for about 4 minutes per side.

If you‚Äôre adding cheese, place a slice of cheese on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.

3. Toast the buns:
While the burgers are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a skillet, cut side down, for 1‚Äì2 minutes until golden brown.

4. Assemble the burgers:
Place the cooked patties on the bottom half of each toasted bun.

Add your desired toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and a slice of cheese if not already melted.

5. Add condiments:
Spread ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or any other condiments of your choice on the top bun.

6. Serve:
Top the burger with the other half of the bun and serve with fries or a side salad.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Juicy burgers: For extra juicy burgers, use a mix of ground beef and ground pork or lamb.

Vegetarian option: Use a veggie patty or a portobello mushroom cap as the patty.

Spicy burger: Add jalape√±os, hot sauce, or pepper jack cheese for a kick.

Toppings: Get creative with your toppings! Try bacon, avocado, fried onions, or a fried egg for a fun twist.
