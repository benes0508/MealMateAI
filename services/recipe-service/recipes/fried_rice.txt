Classic Fried Rice
Ingredients (serves 4):
2 cups cooked rice (preferably cold, day-old rice works best)

2 tbsp vegetable oil (or sesame oil for extra flavor)

2 eggs, beaten

1 small onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup mixed vegetables (frozen peas, carrots, corn, or fresh bell peppers)

2‚Äì3 tbsp soy sauce (adjust to taste)

1 tbsp oyster sauce (optional, for extra umami)

1 tsp sesame oil (optional, for flavor)

1‚Äì2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)

Optional: cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu (about 1 cup)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
Prepare the rice:

If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a baking sheet to cool slightly. Cold, day-old rice works best for fried rice because it's drier and less sticky.

Scramble the eggs:

Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat.

Add the beaten eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until scrambled. Remove from the pan and set aside.

Cook the vegetables:

In the same pan, add the remaining oil.

Saut√© onion and garlic for 2‚Äì3 minutes until softened.

Add mixed vegetables (frozen or fresh) and cook for another 3‚Äì4 minutes until tender.

Fry the rice:

Add the cold rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry for 5‚Äì7 minutes, allowing the rice to get slightly crispy and heated through.

Season:

Add soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil. Stir well to coat the rice evenly.

Combine eggs and protein:

Stir the scrambled eggs and any cooked protein (chicken, shrimp, tofu) into the rice. Cook for another 2‚Äì3 minutes, mixing everything together.

Garnish and serve:

Remove from heat and garnish with chopped green onions. Serve hot!

üìù Tips & Variations:
Vegetarian version: Skip the protein and add extra veggies like broccoli, mushrooms, or zucchini.

Spicy version: Add a little sriracha or chili paste for some heat.

Make it gluten-free: Use tamari or coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.
