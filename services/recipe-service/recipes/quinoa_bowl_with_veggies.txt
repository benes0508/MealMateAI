1 tbsp olive oil (optional)

Salt, to taste

For the Veggies:

1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved

1 cucumber, diced

1 avocado, sliced

1 cup bell peppers, diced (any color)

1/2 red onion, thinly sliced

1/2 cup corn (fresh or frozen)

1/2 cup fresh spinach or arugula (optional)

1/4 cup fresh herbs, like cilantro or parsley, chopped (optional)

For the Dressing:

1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 garlic clove, minced (optional)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Cook the quinoa:
Rinse the quinoa under cold water to remove any bitterness.

In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa and water (or vegetable broth) and bring to a boil.

Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and the water is absorbed.

Remove from heat and let the quinoa sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Then fluff with a fork.

Optional: Stir in a bit of olive oil for extra flavor.

2. Prepare the veggies:
While the quinoa is cooking, chop and prepare your vegetables.

Dice the cucumber, halve the cherry tomatoes, slice the avocado, and dice the bell peppers and red onion.

If using fresh spinach or arugula, rinse and dry the leaves.

3. Make the dressing:
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice (or apple cider vinegar), honey or maple syrup (if using), Dijon mustard (optional), minced garlic (if using), salt, and pepper until well combined.

4. Assemble the quinoa bowl:
Divide the cooked quinoa between two bowls.

Top with the prepared veggies: cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, bell peppers, red onion, corn, and spinach or arugula.

Drizzle the dressing over the top of the bowls and garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley.

5. Serve:
Mix everything together before eating, and enjoy your nutritious and colorful quinoa bowl!

üìù Tips & Variations:
Add protein: For extra protein, you can add chickpeas, grilled chicken, tofu, or feta cheese on top.

Different grains: Swap quinoa for brown rice, couscous, or farro for a variation on the base.
