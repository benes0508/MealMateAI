Grilled Salmon
Ingredients (serves 4):
4 salmon fillets (about 6 oz / 170 g each)

2 tbsp olive oil

1 lemon (zested and sliced)

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tbsp fresh dill or parsley, chopped (optional)

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 tsp smoked paprika (optional for extra flavor)

1 tbsp soy sauce or Dijon mustard (optional for a different flavor profile)

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:
1. Prepare the salmon:
Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 400¬∞F / 200¬∞C).

Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. This will help the fillets cook more evenly and get a nice crispy texture.

Drizzle olive oil over the fillets, and season them generously with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and minced garlic. Add the lemon zest for a bright, citrusy flavor.

2. Preheat the grill:
If you're using a gas grill, preheat it to medium-high heat (400¬∞F / 200¬∞C). If using a charcoal grill, make sure the coals are hot and the grill grates are clean.

If desired, oil the grill grates with a paper towel dipped in oil to prevent the salmon from sticking.

3. Grill the salmon:
Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on the grill. Grill for about 4‚Äì5 minutes on the first side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Do not move the salmon around on the grill to allow a nice sear to form.

Flip the fillets carefully using a spatula and grill for another 3‚Äì4 minutes on the other side. Salmon is done when the internal temperature reaches 145¬∞F (63¬∞C) or when the fish flakes easily with a fork.

4. Add lemon and herbs:
During the last 1‚Äì2 minutes of grilling, add lemon slices to the grill to lightly char them. This brings out their sweetness and adds a smoky citrus flavor.

Optionally, drizzle the grilled salmon with soy sauce or Dijon mustard for an added kick, or sprinkle freshly chopped dill or parsley on top for extra freshness.

5. Serve:
Remove the salmon fillets from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes.

Serve the salmon with charred lemon slices and a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and enjoy with your favorite side dishes like roasted vegetables, rice, or a simple salad.

üìù Tips & Variations:
Marinate the salmon: For extra flavor, marinate the salmon in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs for 30 minutes to 1 hour before grilling.

Spicy version: Add red pepper flakes or a drizzle of sriracha sauce to the marinade for a spicy kick.

Grill foil packet: If you prefer a more delicate texture, wrap the salmon fillets in aluminum foil and grill them for a steaming effect. This will keep them tender and juicy.
