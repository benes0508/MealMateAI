Classic Roast Chicken
Ingredients (serves 4-6):
1 whole chicken (about 4-5 lbs / 1.8-2.3 kg), patted dry

2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter

Salt and pepper, to taste

1 lemon, quartered

4-5 garlic cloves, smashed

1 onion, quartered (optional)

Fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, or parsley), a few sprigs

1 cup chicken broth or water (for roasting)

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. Prepare the chicken:
Remove any giblets from inside the chicken and pat the bird dry with paper towels. Dry skin helps achieve a crispy roast.

Rub the entire chicken with olive oil or melted butter. Season generously with salt and pepper inside and out.

Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the quartered lemon, smashed garlic cloves, onion (if using), and fresh herbs. This will add flavor to the chicken while roasting.

3. Truss the chicken (optional):
To ensure even cooking and a nice presentation, you can truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine and tucking the wing tips under the body. This step is optional, but it helps the chicken cook evenly.

4. Prepare the roasting pan:
Place the chicken in a roasting pan or on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the chicken broth or water into the bottom of the pan. This will create steam, keeping the chicken moist and flavorful.

5. Roast the chicken:
Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) when measured with a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh.

Baste the chicken occasionally (every 20-30 minutes) with the juices from the pan for extra flavor and crispy skin.

Tip: If the chicken skin is browning too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil until it’s done cooking.

6. Rest the chicken:
Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and makes the meat more tender.

7. Carve and serve:
After resting, carve the chicken by removing the legs, wings, and breast meat. Serve with your favorite sides.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Vegetables in the pan: Add sliced carrots, potatoes, and onions to the roasting pan. These will roast in the chicken juices and make a delicious side dish.

Spicy version: Rub the chicken with a mix of paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, and cumin for a spicier roast.

Stuffing: You can stuff the chicken with a breadcrumb-based stuffing (be sure to cook it thoroughly).

Herb butter: For added flavor, make an herb butter by mixing butter with minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, and lemon zest, then rub it under the skin of the chicken before roasting.
