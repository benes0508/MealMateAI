Greek Yogurt Parfait
Ingredients (serves 1–2):
1 cup Greek yogurt (plain or vanilla)

½ cup granola (store-bought or homemade)

½–1 cup fresh fruit (e.g., berries, sliced banana, mango, or apple)

1–2 tsp honey or maple syrup (optional)

Optional add-ins:

Chia seeds

Nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts)

Shredded coconut

A sprinkle of cinnamon

Instructions:
Layer the ingredients in a glass or jar:

Start with a few spoonfuls of Greek yogurt.

Add a layer of granola.

Add a layer of fresh fruit.

Repeat the layers until your glass is full.

Drizzle honey or maple syrup over the top.

Top with any extras like nuts, seeds, or coconut.

Serve immediately (or store in the fridge for up to a few hours — just know the granola may soften).
