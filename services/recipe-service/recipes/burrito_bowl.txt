Make the cilantro-lime rice (optional):

If you want cilantro-lime rice, toss the cooked rice with fresh lime juice, chopped cilantro, and salt to taste. Set aside.

Prepare the protein:

Cook your choice of protein (chicken, beef, or tofu). For chicken, grill or pan-sear it, then slice it into strips. Season with taco seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, or your favorite spices.

Warm the beans and corn:

In a small pan, heat the beans and corn over medium heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.

Assemble the burrito bowls:

Start by placing a scoop of the cilantro-lime rice or plain rice at the bottom of each bowl.

Add a portion of beans, corn, and your chosen protein on top of the rice.

Arrange sliced avocado, red onion, diced tomatoes, and lettuce (if using) around the bowl.

Add toppings:

Top the bowl with shredded cheese, sour cream or Greek yogurt, salsa or pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.

Drizzle with hot sauce if you like extra heat.

Serve:

Serve the burrito bowls with lime wedges on the side for extra zest!
