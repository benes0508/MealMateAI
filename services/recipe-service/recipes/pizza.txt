Classic Homemade Pizza
Ingredients (for one 12-inch pizza):
For the Dough:

2 ¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)

1 ½ cups warm water (about 110°F / 45°C)

1 tsp sugar

3 ½ cups all-purpose flour

2 tbsp olive oil

1 tsp salt

1 tsp dried oregano (optional)

For the Sauce:

1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce

1 tbsp olive oil

1 clove garlic, minced

1 tsp dried oregano

1 tsp sugar

Salt and pepper, to taste

For the Toppings:

1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese

½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 cup fresh basil leaves (optional)

Toppings of your choice: pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, sausage, or whatever you prefer!

🧑‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Make the pizza dough:
In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until frothy.

In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and dried oregano. Add olive oil and the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough begins to come together.

Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook.

Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a clean towel. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

2. Prepare the pizza sauce:
In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

Add the tomato sauce, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir and simmer for 10–15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Adjust seasoning to taste.

3. Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating for a crispier crust.

4. Shape the dough:
Punch down the risen dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Roll it out into a 12-inch circle, or stretch it by hand to the desired shape and thickness.

5. Assemble the pizza:
Place the rolled-out dough onto a parchment paper or lightly floured pizza peel (if using a stone).

Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough.

Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese, followed by Parmesan cheese.

Add your chosen toppings evenly over the cheese.

6. Bake the pizza:
Carefully slide the pizza into the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone if using).

Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.

7. Finish and serve:
Remove the pizza from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves (optional).

Slice and serve immediately.

📝 Tips & Variations:
Gluten-free: Use a gluten-free pizza dough mix or base.

Vegan: Skip the cheese or use dairy-free cheese, and top with veggies like mushrooms, spinach, or zucchini.

Thin crust: Roll the dough thinner for a crispier crust, or thicker for a chewy, bread-like texture.

Double the sauce: For extra sauciness, add more sauce before baking!
