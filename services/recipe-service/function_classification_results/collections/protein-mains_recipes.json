Using a sharp, heavy knife and working just to the side of the center of the breast, cut down through to the breastbone (do not cut all the way through to the backbone). Now that the path has been created, use the same knife\u2014or, easier, a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors\u2014to make a clean cut all the way through the breastbone and anything else that is still connecting the 2 sides of the breast together. Open up chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on chicken to flatten. Pat thoroughly dry.\nGrind peppercorns in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor or leave in mortar and pestle and add garlic, cilantro roots, brown sugar, fish sauce, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, and cardamom and process or pound until smooth. Coat chicken completely in marinade, pressing to adhere and working into nooks and crannies. Place in a large bowl and cover with a plate. Let chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\nLet chicken sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling or baking.\nPur\u00e9e pineapple and vinegar in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and add garlic, jalape\u00f1os, granulated sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat so sauce is at a simmer and cook until thick and smooth (consistency should be similar to cocktail sauce), about 5 minutes.\nGrind saffron to a fine powder in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and add granulated sugar, salt, and \u00bc cup water and cook over medium heat just until heated through and small bubbles appear around the edges of the pan. Whisk in coconut oil and remove from heat.\nIf using a grill, prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on cooler part of grill. Close lid and grill, rotating chicken but keeping skin side up every 5\u201310 minutes, until skin looks dry and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes. If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.\nUncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nIf using an oven, place a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Place chicken, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush one third of basting liquid over skin. Bake, rotating baking sheet every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 450\u00b0. Brush remaining basting liquid over skin and continue to bake, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is crisp and charred and thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes. Carve up further as desired.\nTop dipping sauce with cilantro. Serve chicken with rice and dipping sauce alongside.\nIf you cook the chicken in the oven, using the dhungar method to perfume the finished chicken with the scent of smoky ghee is highly recommended."

Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.\nOnce the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.\nSprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired."

Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours.

Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.\nTo serve on the rolls, top with whichever of the following makes you the happiest: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, reserved marinade, pepperoncini, olives.

Top the noodles with the cooked shrimp and squid, alternating shrimp and squid around the platter. Sprinkle on the crushed pork rinds, smoked tofu, and tinapa.\nServe immediately with lemon wedges.\nIn a stockpot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally and making sure not to let it brown, for 4 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and shrimp shells and cook, stirring continuously, until the shells turn pink.\nAdd the annatto seeds, crab paste, lemon juice, fish sauce, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 12 cups (3 L) water and raise the heat to high. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 1 hour. Strain the stock, discarding the solids, and set it aside until ready to use or refrigerate it overnight. Reheat it gently before making the sauce.\nLeftover stock can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to a month."

    "instructions": "Wipe the mushrooms with a piece of damp paper towel to remove dirt and grit; twist out and discard the stalks. Place in a large roasting tray with the garlic, thyme, Marsala, oil and salt and pepper. Rub each mushroom with the garlicky oil and cover the tray with tin foil. Place in an oven heated to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have reduced in size and are soft throughout. Remove the foil, drain away the cooking liquid and set the tray on a cool surface while you prepare the rest of the Wellington.\nFor the onions, melt the butter with the oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. When all the butter has melted, add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions turn soft and translucent. Add the thyme, garlic and Marsala to the pan and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until the onions are golden and caramelized all over. Remove the onions from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels to drain away the excess oil and butter. Leave to cool completely.\nNext, make the pancakes. Whisk the eggs with the flour in a large mixing bowl, then slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time until no lumps are visible. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface of the batter.\nWarm a 26 cm. (10 in.) non-stick frying pan with a splash of sunflower oil over a medium-high heat. Pour half a ladle of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to evenly coat the base.\nCook each pancake for a minute on each side, until lightly golden, then flip and cook the other side. The mixture should produce 6-8 thin pancakes.\nCook the spinach for a minute with a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg in a frying pan until bright green and just wilted. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can through a sieve, then dry on kitchen paper.\nLay out a 30cm (12 in.) piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface, then lay 4 cooled pancakes alongside each other on the plastic wrap (you can use any extra when making the Wellington), ensuring a generous amount of overlap so that there is a continuous length down the middle of the plastic wrap. Brush the pancake all over with some of the egg yolk, then arrange the spinach down the middle of the pancakes, leaving a couple of centimeters at each end without spinach.\nPlace the mushrooms on top of the spinach, placing one on top of the other, giving four layers of two down the center. Top the mushrooms with the caramelized onion mixture, then use the plastic wrap to lift the pancake over the filling on either side. Fold over the ends and continue rolling until you have a tight cylinder shape. If there are any gaps, use the extra pancakes to patch up, brushing with egg yolk as you go. Wrap the pancake tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nRoll out the sheet of puff pastry and brush with egg yolk. Remove the chilled pancake cylinder from the fridge and unwrap the cling film. Place in the middle of the puff pastry sheet and fold the pastry over the filled pancake to encase it completely. Crimp the sides of the pastry and brush with egg yolk all over. Scatter over the black onion seeds and cook in an oven heated to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 25-30 minutes, until dark golden all over.\nWhile the Wellington is cooking, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat, then add the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the thyme and dry sherry and bring to the boil. Reduce for 3 minutes, then add the stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, then add the heavy cream and turn the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.\nServe the Wellington with the tarragon cream sauce in a jug for pouring over and steamed broccolini and kale on the side."

Remove wing; repeat on the other side.\nCut through skin connecting 1 leg to carcass. Pull leg back until the ball joint pops out of its socket; cut through the joint to separate leg. Repeat on the other side.\nNow for the breast: Position the turkey breast side down with the opening facing you. Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of backbone until you get all the way through the neck end, then turn the turkey 180\u00b0F and cut through the other side to remove the backbone (save it for making stock).\nVery finely grind black and pink peppercorns in a spice mill or mortar and pestle; transfer to a medium bowl. Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and 1 Tbsp. brown sugar and use your fingers to mix together.\nPlace turkey pieces, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle salt mixture liberally all over turkey, patting to adhere. You may not need all of it, but it\u2019s good to have extra since some will end up on the baking sheet. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.\nRemove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil to make cleanup easy and set rack back inside.

Toast, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the crumbs to a medium bowl. Chop the cooked bacon very finely. Add it to the crumbs and toss well. Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper. There should be about 1 3/4 cups. Set aside.\nFor the eggs, bring water in a medium saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Add the salt. Fill a medium bowl with ice water and set aside.\nPoach 4 eggs at a time. Crack 1 egg into a small cup or saucer. Hold the cup in the simmering water and slip the egg in. Repeat with 3 more eggs. Slip a spatula under the eggs, giving them a gentle nudge, to keep them from resting on the bottom of the pan. Poach the eggs until the whites turn opaque but the yolks remain soft, 2\u20133 minutes. Lift the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon or spatula into the bowl of ice water to quickly stop the cooking. Meanwhile, poach the remaining 4 eggs.\nWhen the eggs are cold, set them on paper towels to drain. Trim off any ragged egg whites to tidy up the egg into a neat shape. Gently pat the 8 eggs all over with paper towels so they are dry for coating.\nPut the flour in a medium bowl. Beat the remaining 3 eggs with 1 Tbsp. water in another medium bowl. Arrange 3 bowls as follows: flour\u2013eggs\u2013crumbs. Working with 1 poached egg at a time, gently dredge in flour; next gently roll in beaten eggs, covering it completely; then dredge in the crumbs. Set the crumb-coated egg on a parchment paper\u2013lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 7 eggs, spacing the eggs evenly in one layer. The eggs can stay like this, at room temperature, for up to 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.

Melt 8 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, and continue with the recipe, adding 1 Tbsp. minced fresh tarragon leaves and 3 Tbsp. minced fresh parsley leaves with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nChorizo crumbs: Follow the directions for seasoned crumbs, omitting the bacon. Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in the skillet over medium heat, and continue with the recipe, adding 1/4 cup finely minced Spanish chorizo with salt and freshly ground black pepper."

This prevents the meat from overcooking, while keeping in its moisture.\nOPTIONAL: You can store the par-fried wings in the fridge and do the second wing fry the next day. Just be sure the wings are at room temperature when you fry them.\nOnce the wings cool down, reheat the oil to 350\u00b0F and fry them a second time for 10 more minutes. The second fry crisps the wings to the point of delicious crunchiness. Remove wings, then shake off excess oil. Brush on or toss wings in a bowl with your favorite sauce.

Pour this mixture into a large roasting pan.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the eggs, and then dump the chicken pieces into the eggs.\nHeat the oil in a large heavy skillet to 350\u00b0F. Place a brown paper bag on the counter next to where you are working so you can easily put the chicken on it to drain when you are done frying.\nOne piece at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour coating. I like to really press the coating onto the chicken so it gets a super crunchy bite. Start by frying one piece at a time. Remove from the oil after 3 to 4 minutes, when the tenders are golden brown. Place on the brown paper bag. Repeat, frying no more than 4 tenders at a time.\nServe with mashed potatoes and green beans."

    "instructions": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and fry for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Add the bacon and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden, dabbing off any milky liquid with paper towels. Add the black and/or white pudding slices to the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until beginning to crisp; the white pudding (if using) should turn golden. Remove the sausages, bacon, and pudding slices from the pan and drain on paper towels.\nPlace in an ovenproof dish in a low oven to keep warm.\nMeanwhile, add a dash of oil and pat (knob) of butter to another frying pan over medium heat. Add the button mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and turning golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep warm (adding to the dish with the sausages and bacon). If you are cooking a large flat mushroom, then add the oil and butter to the pan and fry the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and browned.\nSeason the cut side of the tomato halves with salt and pepper and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of oil. Gently fry them, cut side down first, for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.\nAlternatively, cook the large flat mushroom and/or the tomatoes in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.\nTo fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.\nFor scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.\nWhile the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.\nTo serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish."

Working one at a time, add a patty to griddle and immediately press one of the spatulas flat on top of the patty. Use the handle of the other to hammer the spatula down, smashing the patty until 1/2 inch thick. (You'll have to hammer harder and longer than you might think.) Press down and slide the spatula to remove it without tearing the patty; generously season patty with salt and pepper. Repeat smashing process with remaining patties.\nFlip each patty once the first side is deeply browned and crisp with craggly edges, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes for medium. Season the cooked side generously with salt and pepper, then add a slice of cheese and continue to cook until melted, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes more. Transfer cooked patties to bottom burger buns.\nTop burgers with tomatoes and lettuce; spread top buns with Not-So-Secret Sauce and place on top. Serve immediately."

    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. If convection is an option, choose it.\nMake the ducks. Cut away the flap of fatty skin from the neck, and scrape any loose fat from inside the cavities. Prick the skin all over gently with a sharp fork, or cross-hatch it with a sharp knife. Be careful not to pierce the meat.\nFill an 18-quart stock pot (or as large as you have) about two-thirds full with water, and add the salt. Place the bunches of thyme and rosemary and the garlic cloves in it. Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.\nStuff each of the ducks\u2019 cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.\nLine the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nRoast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.\nDepending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180\u00b0F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don\u2019t dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the stock, giblets, and necks in a saucepot over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.\nFinish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat\u2013flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.\nWhen the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.\nPlace the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side."

Working in batches and using 1/2 cup oil total, place a few eggplant spears in a large bowl and drizzle with some oil. Toss, gently massaging each piece to coat; season with kosher salt and pepper. (Because eggplants are very porous when raw, working with a few pieces at a time makes it easier to control where the oil ends up.)

Cover baking sheet with foil, sealing tightly.\nPlace baking sheet with eggplant mixture on bottom rack of oven and baking sheet with lamb on top rack. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of lamb (avoiding gaps) registers 140\u00b0F for medium, about 90 minutes (start checking after 1 hour).

Tear off 4 large sheets of foil. Rub fish with 1/2 cup oil (2 Tbsp. per piece) and season with salt. Working one at a time, place a fillet in the center of a sheet of foil and top with 2 rosemary sprigs. Fold in short sides of foil over fish, then fold in long sides and roll edges together to seal.\nPlace pouches on cool side of grill, cover grill, and cook fish, turning once, 20\u201325 minutes. Open a pouch to check fish. Flesh should be slightly opaque and the tip of a knife should slide through easily. Grill a little longer if needed.\nMeanwhile, combine parsley, celery leaves, and garlic in a medium bowl. Finely zest lemon into bowl, then squeeze in juice. Add red pepper flakes and mix in remaining 3/4 cup oil; season with salt and black pepper. Let salsa verde sit 10 minutes for flavors to come together.\nTransfer fish to a platter and serve with salsa verde and aioli."

    "instructions": "For the miso butter, combine the softened butter and miso together in a small bowl. Add the green onions and pepper and combine. Keep at room temperature or roll into a 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) wide log in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cut into slices before serving.\nThere is one key difference to this method for thick steaks. The first step is to slightly warm the steaks in the oven before cooking on the stove. Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Add your cast-iron skillet to the oven to warm up. I like to use a preheated cast-iron pan because it retains heat very well for searing. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.\nPat dry the steaks with paper towels, pressing out as much surface moisture as possible. Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Transfer the steaks to the wire rack and place in the oven. The heat helps to dry the free moisture on the surface of the steaks for quicker browning and cook time in the pan.\nCook the steak until the internal temperature reaches 90 to 95\u00b0F (32 to 35\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 100 to 105\u00b0F (38\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C) for medium, about 15 to 20 minutes. The time will vary depending on the thickness of the steaks. Remove the steaks from the oven.\nIn the warmed 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add the steaks and sear until browned with a nice crust, about 2 minutes. Flip the steaks with tongs and sear until browned, 1\u00bd to 2 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium.\nReduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic and white and light green parts of green onion. Turn the steaks onto their sides to cook and render any remaining fat, about 1 to 2 minutes. Briefly baste the steaks with the butter, garlic and green onion mixture. Basting the steaks as they cook with oil helps distribute any aromatics like herbs in the pan and evenly browns the surface. The butter is added toward the end to add flavor, mouthfeel and encourage more browning due to the milk protein solids in the butter.\nImmediately transfer the steaks to a clean wire rack set on a sheet pan to rest for 10 minutes. Serve the steaks topped with the miso butter, green onions and cilantro.\nPreheating the steak at low temperature activates enzymes called cathepsins in the meat that help to tenderize the beef, which occurs below 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C). The goal with searing is to achieve a quick sear to create a thick brown crust on the steak without overcooking the interior."

    "instructions": "Cut the bottom 1/2 inch off each lemongrass stalk and trim the woody top portion of each stalk and discard. Peel the outer layers of each stalk until you reach the tender center. Thinly slice the stalks into coins, then very finely mince. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the pork, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper and mix to combine. Roll into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and set on a rimmed baking sheet. The meatballs can be made beforehand; transfer to a lidded container or tightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use but no longer than 24 hours.\nIn a small jar with a lid, combine the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and minced chile. Put the lid on the jar and shake vigorously until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside (the dressing will keep, refrigerated, for up to a week, though it gets spicier as it sits).\nPour the oil into a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and add the sliced shallots to the cold oil. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby. As the oil heats, the shallots will begin to sizzle and bubble; fry, stirring frequently for even cooking, until the shallots begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until they are an even golden brown and crisp (at this stage, they can go from nicely browned to acrid and overcooked very quickly, so be vigilant). Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to the paper-towel- lined plate. Let the oil cool, then pour through a fine- mesh sieve into a clean jar. (Do not discard the oil; it\u2019s liquid gold, great for another batch of fried shallots or to add flavor to dressings and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, and you can also use it to make a batch of aioli.) The fried shallots can be made in advance. Let cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. Resist snacking on them; they'll keep for about a week.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water is boiling add the vermicelli noodles and cook according to package instructions until tender. Drain, rinse with cold water, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with a tablespoon of the shallot oil (it\u2019s fine if it\u2019s still warm) and toss to coat.\nPreheat the broiler to high. Transfer the baking sheet of meatballs to the oven, positioning it a few inches from the heating element. Broil the meatballs until browned, about 3 minutes, then roll the meatballs to the second side and broil for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl.\nTo serve, arrange the vermicelli on a platter and surround with carrots, cucumber slices, lettuce, mint, and cilantro leaves. Serve the meatballs, dressing, fried shallots, and chopped peanuts alongside. Let the diners dig in, serving themselves some of the noodles, carrots, and cucumbers, garnished with herbs, shallots, and peanuts. Spoon dressing over each serving and top with a few meatballs."

Rub lamb all over with herb paste. Bring up foil around lamb and wrap tightly to seal. Roast until lamb is super tender and is falling off the bone, 4\u20134 1/2 hours. (It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t open the foil packet once sealed. To check the meat, slide a skewer or small knife through the top of the foil; the meat should yield and shred easily.)\nMeanwhile, place potatoes in a large pot. Pour in water to cover; season with salt. Cover pot and bring water to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a medium bowl.\nUnwrap lamb (juices will run everywhere, so be careful to make sure they stay on the baking sheet) and let cool 20 minutes. Transfer lamb to a cutting board. Pull meat off bone and shred into pieces. Return meat to baking sheet and toss in herby juices.\nTransfer lamb to a platter. Pour juices over lamb and potatoes. Top lamb with reserved herb mixture. Drizzle lamb and potatoes with oil and lemon juice, then sprinkle with sea salt."

Transfer the rest to a large mixing bowl and add the short ribs. Toss the ribs to coat, cover the bowl, and let them marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours (you can get away with marinating for 6 hours at a minimum, though the satay will have less depth of flavor).\nWhen it is time to cook the ribs, preheat your grill until very hot. I highly recommend cooking satay on an outdoor grill over charcoal briquettes, but gas will suffice (cook them indoors in a grill pan only if you have a very good exhaust system, since they generate a lot of smoke). Make the baste by mixing the reserved 1/4 cup marinade with the 1/3 cup coconut milk. Grill the ribs for about 2 minutes on each side (a little more or less, depending on how you like your meat). As they cook, brush the ribs with the basting liquid and a sprinkling of salt. Let the cooked ribs rest for 2 minutes before serving with the satay peanut sauce and cucumber ajat. Accompany with jasmine or sticky rice or slices of toasted white bread."

Pour 2 tablespoons of the egg mixture into each muffin cup, then top each with 1 teaspoon of goat cheese.\nBake the omelets for 20 minutes, then let them rest for 5 minutes in the pan (this will help them stay together).\nYou can use any cheese you like! Cheddar and feta both work well. If you like spice, add a few dashes of your favorite hot sauce to the eggs. If you want to add meat, crumble 2 cooked sausage patties and add them to the veggies.\nSave more time in the morning by prepping the omelets the night before. Fill the muffin cups with veggies and whisk the eggs in a bowl, cover both with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge. The next morning, give the eggs another quick whisk, then pour them into the muffin cups, top with cheese, and pop in the oven. This will take less than 5 minutes.\nYou can reheat these for the very busiest mornings. Make and refrigerate them a few days ahead and pop them in a 200\u00b0F oven while you get ready. They need 20 minutes to heat, but can be left in the oven to stay warm for up to an hour."

Place chicken skin side down on a cutting board and find the short row of small rib bones near the outer edge of the breast. Grip them with your fingers and pull them off (or use a paring knife or shears). Next: along the center line where the breast was cut in half, there\u2019s a dark, vaguely rectangular bone\u2014it almost looks like an anvil. Sometimes it\u2019s in one piece, or both sides will have a half of it. It doesn\u2019t matter: Grip the bone with your fingers and pull it out, then tease out the strip of flexible cartilage just below it. All done! Now the chicken will lay flat in the pan, which is why it cooks so quickly.\nSeason both sides of chicken with salt, then with all of the spice rub. Remove hot skillet from oven and set over medium-high heat. Add oil, then lay chicken into pan, skin side down. Use a spatula to firmly press chicken against surface, then add 1 lime to pan, placing sides down. Cook until skin is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven, lay reserved foil over chicken, then weight with second pan. Cook 10 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven and turn chicken over; cook second side in residual heat 1 minute.

As soon as the sugar is out of the oven, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on high speed until they begin to froth up. Carefully add the hot sugar to the egg whites, 1 tbsp at a time, and continue beating for 7\u20138 minutes until the mixture is completely cold. At this point it should be silky and thick and keep its shape when you lift a little bit from the bowl.\n. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Use an extra-large serving spoon to scoop up some meringue, and use another large spoon to help shape it into a rough ball the size of a large apple. Sprinkle some praline over half the meringue ball, then place on the baking sheet, repeat with the rest of the mixture, spacing the balls as far apart as possible, as they will increase in size.\nPlace the meringues in the oven for 2\u20132 1/2 hours. Check that they are done by lifting them from the baking sheet and gently tapping to make sure the outside is completely firm and the center is only a little soft. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking sheet to cool.\nThese will keep for up to 10 days. If you are not hanging them on the tree, wrap them loosely in aluminum foil and keep at room temperature."

Raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, and boil until the florets are soft, about 10 minutes or so. Strain the cauliflower, reserving the stock. Add the florets to the onion, and mash them up a bit with a fork.\nUsing the same pot, melt the butter over low heat (no need to clean the pot first). Use a pastry brush to swirl some of the melted butter around the insides of the ramekins. Cut circles of parchment paper to fit the bottoms of the ramekins. Butter the circles, and set them in place. Set the ramekins aside.\nAdd the flour to the remaining butter in the pan, whisking with a fork as you add to prevent lumps. Add the reserved stock a little at a time, whisking as you pour. Raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken, whisking to prevent and break up any lumps. Add the stock mixture to the cauliflower and onions, and toss to coat. Add the nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and black pepper to the bowl, and stir, mixing thoroughly. Let cool for 5 minutes.\nOnce the cauliflower mixture has cooled a bit, fold in the cheeses. Add the eggs, and fold them in as well. Spoon the mixture into the ramekins. Pour a cup or so of hot water into a 9x13-inch casserole, and place the ramekins in the baking dish.\nBake until the sformati are set and the tops are browned, about 40 minutes. (If the water evaporates during baking, add more hot water.) Remove the ramekins from the casserole, and let sit until they are thoroughly cool. (Since they are served at room temperature, you can make the sformati well in advance.)\nWhen ready to serve, toss the salad greens with the lemon\u2013olive oil dressing. Unmold the sformati by running a thin knife around the edge of the ramekins. Place a small plate on top of each ramekin, and invert it, tapping lightly if necessary. The sformati should come out of the mold in one piece. Peel and discard the parchment. Serve, browned side up, with the greens on the side."

Then, using a pair of kitchen shears, snip between rows to create a diamond-shape pattern, spacing about 3/4\" apart.

Try to get the spices into the fatty layer and not on the surface of the skin, where they may burn as the shoulder roasts. Make sure to use all of the spices, even though it may seem like a lot.

Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.\nMeanwhile, toss onions, squash, pancetta, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper.\nOnce oven reaches temperature, pat chicken dry with paper towels and lightly coat with half of remaining oil; sprinkle with dry rub, if using. Drizzle remaining oil into hot skillet (this helps keep the chicken from sticking and tearing the skin). Place chicken in the center of skillet and arrange squash mixture around. Roast until vegetables are golden brown and tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 155\u00b0F, 50\u201360 minutes (temperature will climb to 165\u00b0F as chicken rests). Let chicken rest in skillet at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and carve. Serve with vegetables."

Serve hot and pass extra Parmesan at the table.\nWhen you add the Parmesan in Step 4, you can add any of the following to the pot, alone or in combination; stir over medium heat for another minute or two. 1 tablespoon pur\u00e9ed chipotles in adobo sauce 4 cups sliced mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed 3 cups lightly cooked tiny broccoli florets 2 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as oregano, thyme, or parsley Or, you can serve up portions of Chicken Alfredo Pasta for those who like it plain and simple, and add proportionate amounts of any of the add-ins to the pot.\nWhile it's certainly reasonable to thrill over a meal of reheated leftover Alfredo pasta, either warmed on the stovetop or in the microwave, this dish is best when it's made just before serving."

(Placing them on top of the coals will cause them to burn too quickly; you want the wood to catch slowly and smolder.) Place grate on grill and cover grill, positioning vent on lid as far from heat source as possible. (This will help draw the smoke up and over the meat as it rises.)\nIf using a gas grill, prepare grill for medium-low indirect heat, leaving one or two burners off. Place wood chips in smoker box and set over direct heat; cover grill.\nStick an ovenproof probe thermometer through top vent if your grill has one. Heat until thermometer registers around 275\u00b0F, adjusting vents on bottom and top of grill or control knobs as needed to maintain temperature. Get any high-heat grilling done while you wait for the temperature to drop.\nMeanwhile, mix paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chile powder, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Arrange wings on a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle half of rub over top. Turn over and sprinkle remaining rub over other side. Let sit at room temperature until grill is ready.\nPlace wings on grill over indirect heat, leaving a small gap between each piece to allow smoke to circulate. Smoke wings, replenishing wood as needed (and adding a coal or two of charcoal as needed), until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165\u00b0F, 1 1/2\u20132 hours (as long as smoke is circulating well in grill, you shouldn\u2019t need to turn wings).\nJust before wings are done, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Season liberally with kosher salt and pepper and thoroughly combine the mixture with clean hands. Transfer to the baking dish and spread out evenly to the edges, smoothing the top flat.

Remove the pan from the water bath and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or, ideally, 24 hours, to develop the flavors.\nPlace a large, flat platter upside down over the baking dish. Turn both over, and carefully remove the gyro.

    "instructions": "Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl (or 22-quart plastic Cambro containers, like we do) until it becomes one unified homogenous mixture of red chili sauce. It should taste spicy, sweet, and savory and not too ketchup-y.\nClean crab and cut into pieces. If you have never done this before, this might sound easier said than done, but it's not nearly as daunting as it seems.\nIn a debate of \u201chumane\u201d ways of killing crab: the Asian preparation of crab is a near-instant killing of the crab versus the longer and drawn out steaming/boiling method. Additionally, the boiling method tends to result in a much fishier \u201ccrabby\u201d flavor, not as fresh tasting as with this method. If you look up videos on YouTube, look up \u201cHow to kill a live crab humanely,\u201d which will demonstrate this way of breaking down a crab.\nWith that said, I wasn\u2019t as prepared in the photograph process, so I\u2019m going to personally walk you through this as the first \u201cCrab Killer\u201d at Starry Kitchen:\nQuick tips: Put crabs in the freezer or refrigerator before breaking down. It will make them sleepy\u2014slow them down very severely. There is also a way one of our cooks, Sean, uncovered on the web to gently pet a soft spot on their shell over and over and they\u2019ll start falling asleep. We\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s crazy, but it takes a lot longer than the freezer method.\nNext, when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019re going to need a decently sharp knife for this process or at least one with a sharp tip for this next step: try to grab the crab from the tail end, and flip the crab over, claws and eyes pointing away from you, and so it\u2019s belly-side up. If you look at its abdomen right in the center, you\u2019ll see a longer triangular lip (top of it pointing away from you) that can actually be lifted up. Until you\u2019re comfortable doing it often, you can use the tip of your knife to lift it up, but you\u2019ll want to use your hand to quickly just lift up and fold it over completely. The crab will potentially get VERY mad at this point. You\u2019ve just exposed its most vulnerable spot.\nThen, this part is simple if you can move quickly: just stab it downward right through that spot that\u2019s been exposed until you reach the shell. Hold for about 10\u201320 seconds. The crab should die almost instantly.\nAfterwards, line your knife across the middle, and firmly press down and cleave it through the abdomen to cut the crab in half. The crab will snap in half once you come all the way down. You\u2019ll also be able to pull the crab by each of its claws, and it\u2019ll just come apart.\nYou\u2019ll then want to turn each half over, and remove the white gills off of each and dispose.\nDispose of the lip, and any other loose appendages from the front and back end of the crab.\nDispose of the white film and any black matter inside the shell itself, but do not clean out the rest of the shell. That orange part, the coral, the fatty tissue is the MOST coveted part of the crab in Asian households (typically held for the father, no joke). It\u2019s like sea urchin/uni, really rich and very briny...and super-awesome to put rice into once it\u2019s cooked and scoop it out with. Yummers!\nDepending on how large your crab is, the two halves of crab legs can be broken into either 2 or 3 sections (there should be a minimum of 2 legs per section) using the same cleaving action as you did to halve the crab.\nAnd that\u2019s it! (If YouTube, this, and the web doesn\u2019t help you feel more comfortable\u2014seriously, feel free to reach out to us: @starrykitchen. This dish is COMPLETELY worth it.)\nNow clean the crab legs again, then pat dry with paper towels. Put into a big bowl with cornstarch, but make sure to leave enough room to coat crab with starch.\nDiligently dredge all exposed crab pieces including the coral and head, inside and out, with starch. Next, shake off excess starch, but make sure all of the exposed (non-shelled) parts are covered in starch. This seals in all of the crab\u2019s flavors throughout the cooking process. This is especially important if you need to prepare in advance.\nFill a wok/pot with 2 to 3 inches cooking oil, enough to submerge crab pieces, including the head. Heat oil to 350\u00b0F over high heat, then carefully fry in batches, arranging crab pieces in a single layer in the oil. Turn over pieces with tongs to fry evenly.\nWhen the crab pieces turn red all over and the battered parts are golden, remove and shake the excess oil over your pot. Set aside (we like to set crab on a rack/grate and baking sheet to allow a little bit more oil to drip off). Refrigerate for up to 24 hours.\nOnce you\u2019re ready to make your chili crab, heat a wok/pan on high heat and add 1 tablespoon cooking oil per crab. Saut\u00e9 garlic, shallots, ginger, and chiles until aromatic (enough to make you cough\u2014that\u2019s how you know you got the GOOD stuff). Next, add the beautiful monstrosity that is your crab. Stir quickly for 10 to 15 seconds, then add Chili Crab Sauce. Cover, cook over high heat, and cook that bad boy (or girl) for 7 minutes.\nKeep the pan over heat, but remove crab from pan and place on a serving dish. While reconstructing your sea beast, make sure to leave all the sauce in the wok/pan. Crack eggs into the sauce, and quickly mix to fully incorporate them and thicken the sauce. Increase to high heat and reduce sauce to desired thickness. (I like it pretty thick and a little bit gloppy GOOD.) Once done, remove from heat, and pour sauce all over the crab. Garnish with chopped scallions and cilantro. Serve with Buttermilk Beer Beignets. Break down the crab, sop up all that sauce, and eat like a Singaporean king!"

    "instructions": "Bring a large pot full of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the chard and spinach, bring the water back to a boil, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until thoroughly wilted. Drain and squeeze out as much moisture as possible, pressing the greens against a colander with a wooden spoon. Or for a more thorough job, use your hands when the greens have cooled somewhat. Finely chop, either by hand or by pulsing in a food processor.\nIn a large skillet, saut\u00e9 the minced garlic in 3 tablespoons of the oil over moderate heat until pale gold, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chard and spinach. Cook, stirring, over medium heat, until the liquid is evaporated and the garlic is thoroughly distributed, 5 to 7 minutes. The greens should be very tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nSaut\u00e9 the onion in a heavy, medium saucepan over medium heat in 3 tablespoons of the oil until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat the grains with the onions. In another saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer. Add the broth to the rice a few spoonfuls at a time, as if making risotto. Keep the heat medium-low, and stir, waiting until the broth is nearly absorbed before adding another spoonful. Cook the rice until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes in all. If you finish adding the broth and the rice is not yet tender, add a tablespoon or two of hot water, as needed. Season the rice with salt and pepper (taking in to account the saltiness of the broth you are using), add it to the chard and spinach, and set aside to cool.\nBreak the head into single cloves and put them, unpeeled, into a small baking dish in which they fit snugly (I use a 5-inch-square porcelain ramekin). Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the oil and 1 teaspoon of the thyme. Cover tightly (use foil if you don't have a lid), and roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until a soft puree is formed when you squeeze a clove. Avoid overcooking, which turns the garlic bitter. Squeeze the puree out by hand or run the unpeeled cloves through a food mill to trap the peels. Put the roasted garlic puree in a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the rosemary and the lemon juice. Stir well and set aside. Turn off the oven\u2014you will be pan-braising the meat.\nIn a food processor, pulse the remaining 1 tablespoon each of rosemary and thyme, the parsley, mint, and lemon zest until finely chopped. Add to the rice mixture. Stir in the egg until well combined.\nTrim the veal of gristle and as much fat as possible. Sprinkle salt and pepper all over, including the inside pocket. Fill the pocket with the stuffing, pushing the mixture as far in as possible, but don't overfill\u2014it will expand somewhat while cooking. Sew the pocket closed. (A large embroidery needle and strong cotton thread or unwaxed dental floss work very well here. Or use a trussing needle and kitchen twine. I find skewering not as successful here\u2014the stuffing is more likely to ooze out into the pan gravy.)\nIn a 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy casserole just large enough to accommodate the veal, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until hot, but not smoking. Add the veal and brown it slowly on all sides, turning carefully with wooden spoons so you don't piece the meat. When it is thoroughly browned, arrange the meat so that the fat side is up. Spread the roasted garlic mixtue all over the top. Add the wine and bring to a slow bubble. Place the lid slightly askew, and braise at a slow simmer over very low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or longer, if necessary, until the meat is very tender. Use a flame tamer (blech) or stack two stove burner grates , if you must to keep the flame very low. Every 20 minutes or so, baste with the pan juices. If possible, turn the meat a few times; don't worry about losing the roasted garlic coating on top\u2014it will add delicious flavor to the cooking juices.\nTransfer the veal to a platter, and let it stand for 10 minutes, tented with foil to keep warm. Boil up the cooking juices for a few minutes to concentrate the flavors, taste for seasoning, then transfer to a sauce boat.\nSlice the veal about 1/2-inch thick, making sure that the slices enclose some of the filling. Nap with some of the juices. Pass remaining sauce separately.\nDon't pass by this fabulous veal because your family refrains from eating rice on Passover. When my agent Elise Goodman wanted to prepare it for her seder, we came up with a wonderful alternative mashed potato stuffing.\nPrepare the stuffing according to the directions above, omitting rice and broth. Saut\u00e9 the onion until rice gold and set aside. Simmer 3 1/2 cups russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed, in cold, salted water to cover, until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash the potatoes until smooth. Stir in the reserved saut\u00e9ed onion (along with any oil remaining in the pan), and 1 additional tablespoon olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the potato mixture to the chard and spinach, set aside to cool, and continue with the recipe."

After cooking, naturally release the pressure for 10 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer the chicken to a bowl and let it cool for a few minutes. Keep the sauce warm.\nWhen the chicken is just cool enough to handle, cut or pull it into bite-size chunks. Mix in about 2/3 cup of the warm sauce; the chicken should be well coated with sauce but not drowning. Put the onion in a small bowl.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place 6 tortillas on a baking sheet in a single layer. Brush the tortillas lightly with the oil (or spray with cooking spray), then turn them over and repeat on the other side. Bake just until the tortillas are warm and pliable, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the tortillas in a stack on a plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 6 tortillas. (If you have two baking sheets, you can heat them all at once.) Leave the oven on.\nSpoon about 1/2 cup warm sauce into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Place one tortilla in the sauce and flip it so it\u2019s lightly coated on both sides, then place a couple of tablespoons of chicken and a couple of teaspoons of chopped onion on the tortilla.\nFor Mexican-American-style enchiladas: Sprinkle a tablespoon of shredded Monterey Jack cheese over the chicken and onion.\nRoll the tortilla up and place it at the end of the dish, seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. When all the enchiladas are filled and rolled, pour enough sauce over them to just cover them (they should not be swimming in sauce).\nFor Mexican-American-style enchiladas: Sprinkle the rest of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese over the enchiladas.\nBake until warmed through, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the queso fresco over the enchiladas and serve."

    "instructions": "Two days in advance, season the pork shoulder, fresh ham hock or pig\u2019s knuckles, and the pork skin moderately with salt and pepper. Place in an earthenware or glass dish, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Soak the beans overnight in enough water to cover by at least 2 inches.\nThe following day, simmer the pork skin in water to cover until it is supple, 10 to 20 minutes. Drain, roll up the strip, and tie it with string.\nDry the cubes of pork shoulder with paper towels. In an 8- or 9-quart flameproof casserole, heat the duck fat over moderately high heat. Add the pork shoulder and lightly brown on all sides. Add the onions and carrots and saut\u00e9, stirring, until the onions are soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the ham hock or pig\u2019s knuckles and the whole piece of ventr\u00e8che or pancetta. Allow these meats to brown a little around the edges, turning the pieces occasionally. Add the whole head of garlic, and the tomato or tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the stock, bundle of pork skin, and herb bouquet. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the ragout for 1 1/2 hours.\nWhen the ragout has cooked for l hour, drain the beans and put them into a large saucepan, cover with fresh water, and slowly bring to a boil. Skim, and simmer for a few minutes, then drain and immediately add the beans to the simmering ragout. Continue simmering for up to 2 hours, or until the beans are tender. (You can tell when the beans are done by removing one or two beans with a spoon and blowing on them\u2014the skins will burst.) Let cool, then skim off all the fat that has risen to the top; reserve 2 tablespoons of this fat for finishing the cassoulet. Cover the pork ragout and beans and refrigerate overnight to develop the flavors.\nThe next day, steam the duck confit for 10 minutes to soften. As soon as the meat is cool enough to handle, pull it off the bones in large chunks.\nRemove the ragout and beans from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature. Pick out the ham hock or pig\u2019s knuckles, pancetta, garlic head, and herb bouquet. Cut the meat from the ham hock or pig\u2019s knuckles into bite-size pieces, discarding bones and fatty parts. Cut the pancetta into 1-inch pieces, discarding the extraneous fat. Set all the meats aside. Press on the garlic to extract the pulp and set aside. Discard the garlic skins and herb bouquet.\nIn a food processor or electric blender, puree the pork fat or salt pork with the cooked and raw garlic and 1 cup water. Add this garlic puree to the ragout and beans and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Fold reserved meats into the ragout and beans.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. To assemble the cassoulet, remove the roll of pork skin from the ragout. Untie, cut the skin into 2-inch pieces, and use to line a 5 1/2- or 6-quart ovenproof casserole, preferably earthenware, and fat side down\u2014the skin side sticks (see Note below). Using a large slotted spoon or skimmer, add one half of the beans and pork shoulder. Scatter the duck confit on top of the pork and beans. Cover with the remaining beans and pork ragout. Taste the ragout cooking liquid and adjust the seasoning; there will probably be no need for salt. Pour just enough of the ragout liquid over the beans to cover them. Be sure there is at least 1 inch of \u201cgrowing space\u201d between the beans and the rim of the dish. Drizzle with the 2 tablespoons fat reserved in Step 4. Place the casserole in the oven and let cook for 1 1/2 hours.\nPrick the sausages and brown them under a hot broiler or in a skillet. Drain; cut larger sausages into 3- or 4-inch pieces.\nReduce the oven heat to 275\u00b0F. Gently stir up the skin that has formed on the beans. Place the sausages on top of the beans. Dust the bread crumbs on top of the beans and sausage. Bake the cassoulet for 1 more hour. The top crust should become a beautiful golden brown; if it isn\u2019t, turn on the broiler and carefully \u201ctoast\u201d the top layer of beans, about 2 minutes. Transfer the cassoulet from the oven to a cloth-lined surface and let it rest 20 minutes. Drizzle with the walnut oil just before serving."

Use a lid or a splash of water if it's coloring too much before getting soft. Turn the mirepoix out onto a plate and set it aside to cool completely. Grate 1/2 teaspoon zest from the lime and set it aside.\nChop the cod into 1/4-inch dice, place it in a medium bowl, and season it with 3/4 teaspoon salt and some grindings of black pepper. In the bowl of a food processor, combine a quarter of the fish with the cream and pulse until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.

Stir with your hands and squeeze through your fingers to mix everything really well, then heat a skillet to medium, add a teaspoon of oil and fry a little piece for tasting. Adjust as needed and when you have the seasoning right, begin breading: Beat the remaining 2 eggs in a wide, shallow bowl, put the flour in another bowl, and the remaining 2 cups bread crumbs in a third. Have a baking sheet ready to receive the breaded cakes. Pat the fish mixture down in the bowl, smooth the top, divide it in half, then separate each half into 3 parts to make sixths. Scoop up half of one of the sixths, form it into a ball with your hands, flatten it into a patty, and place it in the flour. Turn the patty to coat, shake off the excess, and then place it in the eggs. Turn it to coat completely, let excess egg drip off, and then place it in the crumbs. Coat it completely with crumbs, set it on the baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining mixture until you have 12 fishcakes. Refrigerate them for 20 minutes to 6 hours before cooking.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, heat a skillet to medium-high and heat the oven to warm for holding one batch of fishcakes as you fry the rest. Add 1/4 inch of oil to the skillet and then as many fishcakes as will fit in a single layer. Fry, adjusting the heat as needed, until one side of the cakes is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Peek into one of the cakes to be sure it\u2019s cooked through and then keep the batch warm in the oven while you fry the rest. Right before serving, squeeze lime juice over the fishcakes."

Remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u02daF.\nOnce the vegetable mixture is cool, add the beef, veal, eggs, bread crumbs, and about 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and mix well with scrupulously clean or rubber-gloved hands. Use the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to grease a loaf pan and transfer the mixture to the pan, packing it down gently. Cover the loaf with foil and place the loaf pan on a sheet pan. Cook in the oven for 1 hour.\nRemove the foil and spread the top of the meat loaf with the tomato paste. Continue to cook for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 150\u02daF. Remove from the oven and let the meat loaf rest, in the loaf pan, on a wire rack.\nWhile it rests, make the gravy. In a large, heavy-bottom saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter until it foams and subsides. Add the diced mushrooms and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until their released juices evaporate and the mushrooms begin to squeak against the surface of the pan when stirred. Add the shallots and salt and pepper to taste and continue to cook until the mushrooms get browned and the shallots are translucent or slightly golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir well to evenly coat. Cook over medium heat, stirring more or less constantly, for about 2 minutes, to cook off the raw flour taste, then stir in the stock. Whisk the mixture to pull the stuck flour up from the surface of the pan and into the gravy. Add a splash more stock or water if necessary if the mixture seems too thick, then reduce the heat to low and stir in the cream. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.\nServe the meat loaf in slices, with the gravy ladled over or alongside. Accompany with mashed potatoes if you like."

Poke outside of skin all over with a fork, then roast until flesh is very soft, about 1 1/2 hours for large squash and about 1 hour for medium squash.\nMeanwhile, heat 1 cup cream in a medium pot over medium until just beginning to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in 1/4 cup cheese and cook, whisking, until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a medium bowl and chill until very cold, about 45 minutes (do not freeze).\nCook bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer to paper towels, reserving bacon fat in skillet. Let cool, then finely chop.\nSpread 3 Tbsp. sugar in a thin layer in the center of a medium dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, mostly undisturbed (it's ok to swirl pan gently to get sugar to melt evenly), until sugar melts and starts to turn light brown, about 6 minutes. Quickly stir in bacon and hazelnuts and cook, stirring, until coated and melted sugar is chestnut brown, about 1 minute more. Scrape onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out to cool, then finely chop.\nReduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. Using a spoon, scoop flesh out of large squash into a large bowl, leaving a 1/2\" border around squash shell to help maintain its shape. Transfer large shells to a rimmed baking sheet; arrange a few pieces of crumpled foil around shells to keep them upright. Scoop flesh out of medium shells into same bowl (you should have 6 cups squash); discard medium shells. Using a potato masher or spatula, mix in salt, pepper, nutmeg, 1 Tbsp. reserved bacon fat, and remaining 1 cup cream, 3/4 cup cheese, and 1 Tbsp. sugar until smooth. Fold in 2 Tbsp. chives. Divide filling between large squash shells, then create attractive swoops with a spoon. Bake squash until warmed through, 20\u201330 minutes.\nMeanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed or a whisk, whip chilled cream to medium peaks. Chill until ready to use.\nDollop squash with whipped cream, then top with candied bacon bits and remaining 1 Tbsp. chives. Serve extra candied hazelnut-bacon bits on the side.\nSquash shells can be filled (not baked) 2 days ahead; cover and chill."

Fry, turning occasionally and increasing heat as needed to keep oil temperature between 330\u00b0F and 340\u00b0F, until fritter is golden brown and crisp around edges, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining slurry-coated vegetable and shrimp mixture, adding a splash or so of club soda if needed to loosen batter (it should look like a glossy coating), to make another fritter.\nRepeat entire process with remaining sweet potato and carrot mixture, cilantro, shrimp, and cornstarch slurry to make 2 more fritters.\nSeason fritters lightly with salt. Serve with chile vinegar alongside for dipping.\nChile vinegar can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Vegetables can be salted, drained, and patted dry 1 day ahead. Cover and chill."

Wrap the tortillas in a heavy kitchen towel, lay in the steamer and cover with a tight lid. Boil 1 minute, turn off the heat and let stand without opening the steamer for 15 minutes.\nJust before serving, mix the remaining half of the chopped chiles into the ricotta (plus enough water to make it easily spoonable). One at a time, spread a generous 2 tablespoons of the ricotta filling over each of 8 hot tortillas. Sprinkle with the radishes and onion, lay on a sprig of cilantro and you\u2019re ready for some light, zesty flavors.\nThe filling will hold well for a couple of days in the refrigerator, but is best served at room temperature.

Put the jar and the lid on a clean tea towel to dry.\nPut the vinegar, 1 cup water, sugar, cloves, and fennel seeds in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the fennel to the saucepan with the pickling liquid and bring it back to a simmer. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the fennel is tender.\nTransfer the fennel and liquid to the sterilized jar. Tap the jar as you pour in the liquid to release any air bubbles. Seal the jar well with its lid.\nFill a medium saucepan with water over high heat. Put the jar in the boiling water, turn the heat off and allow it to sit there for 20 minutes, to create a vacuum seal. Set aside the jar on a cloth to cool down completely.\nMeanwhile, make the spice mixture for the brisket. Use a mortar and pestle or food processor to grind or process the garlic powder, coriander, paprika, brown sugar, black pepper and sea salt to a coarse powder.\nRub some of the spice mixture into the brisket on all sides, put in a ziplock bag or covered baking dish and add the remaining spice mixture. Put in the fridge and marinate for at least 5 hours or overnight.\nPreheat the barbecue to high. Take the brisket out of the ziplock bag. The dry spice mixture will have drawn moisture from the meat, so give it a light wipe before placing it on the barbecue. Cook for 30 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, to create a beautifully dark colour and crust.\nReduce the heat to low and cook for 2 1/2 hours, turning every 30 minutes and brushing with the remaining spice mixture every 10 to 20 minutes. Remove the brisket from the heat, wrap in foil and allow to rest for 20 minutes before slicing.\nI like to serve this brisket on a massive platter with the pickled fennel, a few brioche slider buns, slaw, lemon wedges and a\u00efoli."

Cover and refrigerate.\nCut off the root ends of the young leeks and green garlic. Trim away the tough green leek tops and discard or save for making stock. Cut the leeks and garlic in half lengthwise, then chop crosswise into 1/4- to 1/2-inch (6- to 12-mm) pieces. You should have about 2 cups (180 g). If using large leeks and mature garlic, cut the white part of each leek into the same-size pieces and mince the garlic.\nIn a 12-inch (30.5-cm) skillet, heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the colors brighten, about 3 minutes. Cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and reducing the heat as needed to prevent browning, until very tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside. Reserve the skillet.\nBreak the matzo sheets into small pieces into a medium bowl and pour in water to cover. In another medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper until the eggs are well blended. Drain the matzos (don\u2019t be too fussy; just tilt the bowl to pour off the excess water, using your hand to prevent them from tumbling out). Stir the egg and leek mixtures into the matzos.\nReheat the skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and oil over medium heat. The pan is hot enough when a bit of matzo mixture dropped into it sizzles on contact. Pour in the matzo brei batter and smooth the top and edges. Cook, reducing the heat to medium-low as needed to prevent scorching, until the underside is set and golden, about 5 minutes.\nUse the edge of a pancake turner or spatula to cut the matzo brei into 6 wedges. Flip each wedge, rotating the pan as you go so that the pieces fit back into the pan nicely. Continue to cook until the matzo brei is cooked through but not dry, about 3 minutes more. (If you must add more fat to the pan during cooking, tilt the pan, add the fat to the side of the pan still resting on the burner, and hold the pan at this angle for a moment to heat the fat. Then, use your spatula to lift the edge of the matzo brei and tilt the pan in the opposite direction to let the warmed fat run under the matzo brei before you set the pan back squarely on the burner to finish cooking.)\nPlace a wedge of matzo brei on each plate. Drape each wedge with salmon, top with a spoonful or two of horseradish cream, and shower with dill. Use a five-hole zester to zest long strands of lemon peel over each serving and add a squeeze of lemon."

Add the diced pears and sugar, in batches if necessary, season with salt and pepper, and saut\u00e9 until the pears begin to brown slightly. Remove from the heat.\nAdd the saute\u00e9d ingredients to the bread and toss lightly to combine. Add the herbs and toss again. Slowly pour 1 cup of the stock over the mixture and toss.\nAdd enough additional stock to make a very moist stuffing. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper. (If you are stuffing a brined turkey, remember that the juices from the bird will add a bit more salt.)\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Generously butter 12 muffin cups.\nJust before roasting the turkey, put some of the room-temperature stuffing lightly inside the cavity. Place the whole pear in the opening of the cavity to help hold the stuffing in the bird. Roast as directed.\nFill the muffin cups with the remaining stuffing, pressing down so each one is well filled. Top each with 1 tablespoon stock. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until a golden crust forms on the bottom.\nTo serve, use a butter knife to remove the stuffing muffins and invert onto the plates.\nMakes enough stuffing for a 12- to 14-pound turkey and 12 muffins; if not stuffing a turkey, the recipe will fill 2 dozen muffin cups or a small casserole dish."

Rub the flavored oil all over the ricotta and place in the center of the dish, then gently rub the remaining oil over the tomatoes. Add a splash of water to the dish, place in the oven, and roast for 45 minutes, then remove. With 10 minutes to go, cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling salted water according to the package instructions.\nLift the ricotta out of the baking dish, then shake the tomatoes off the vines, discarding the stalks. Add half a cup of pasta water to the dish and gently shake to loosen all the sticky goodness from the base. Drain the spaghetti and toss straight into the dish with a squeeze of lemon juice, season to perfection, then break that beautiful ricotta over the top. Sprinkle over the arugula, toss together well, then serve. My missus likes this with a little drizzle of balsamic too."

Once it is cooked, drain the pasta and then return it to the pan with the lid on to keep warm if necessary.\nCheck to see if the chicken is cooked\u2014if the juices run clear, it is ready. Taste the sauce, adding a little sugar and/or a pat of butter if the sauce is still a bit acidic from the tomatoes. Add a drizzle of water if the sauce is too thick and let it bubble away for a bit longer if too thin.\nDivide the pasta among four plates, top with a piece of chicken breast or two thighs, spoon some sauce over and scatter with some ripped-up basil or parsley leaves, if using."

Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to very low, cover and simmer for 25 minutes.\nRemove the chicken legs, thighs and breasts with tongs or a slotted spoon and let cool. Discard the chicken backs and strain the stock; set aside.\nOnce cool enough to handle, shred the meat and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Set aside.\nPlace the tomatillos in a large saucepan. Add the remaining 2 cloves garlic, peeled, and 2 quarters of the onion. Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then simmer on medium heat until the tomatillos turn pea green and soften, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. (Vegetarians can reserve the cooking water, turn up the flame, and reduce for 15 to 20 minutes, to use in lieu of chicken stock, if they choose.)\nStem the chiles and chop roughly with the cooked garlic. Add to a blender jar with half of the tomatillo mixture, and 1/2 cup of the strained chicken stock. (If you have a high-powered blender, toss all the ingredients in at once.) Blend until smooth. Add the remaining tomatillo-onion mixture and 1 teaspoon salt, and blend again until smooth.\nWarm 1 tablespoon lard in a large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the sauce in one quick pour, being careful as it might splatter. Cook until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes.\nHeat 2 teaspoons lard in a small skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom. Fry the tortillas lightly, one at a time, until slightly tougher but still pliable, about 30 seconds per side. (They shouldn't be crisp.) As you work, remove the fried tortillas to serving plates\u2014I like to serve 4 tortillas per person. Fold the tortillas in a half-moon shape and make sure they sit in an even layer on each plate.\nDice the remaining quarter of onion. Ladle 3/4 cup sauce over over each serving of tortillas, spreading slightly so the tortillas are entirely smothered in sauce. Add a layer of diced onion and cilantro, a layer of shredded cheese, a layer of chicken, some crema and another layer of sauce. Top with another light sprinkling of diced onion."

Quarter the lemons from the top to within 1/2 inch of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, then reshape the fruit.\n3. Place 1 tablespoon salt on the bottom of the mason jar. Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding more salt, and the optional spices between layers. Press the lemons down to release their juices and to make room for the remaining lemons. (If the juice released from the squashed fruit does not cover them, add freshly squeezed lemon juice \u2014 not chemically produced lemon juice and not water.*) Leave some air space before sealing the jar.\n4. Let the lemons ripen in a warm place, shaking the jar each day to distribute the salt and juice. Let ripen for 30 days. To use, rinse the lemons, as needed, under running water, removing and discarding the pulp, if desired \u2014 and there is no need to refrigerate after opening. Preserved lemons will keep up to a year, and the pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a year.\nAccording to the late Michael Field, the best way to extract the maximum amount of juice from a lemon is to boil it in water for 2 or 3 minutes and allow it to cool before squeezing.\n\u2022Located on Morocco's Atlantic coast, south of Casablanca and north of Essaouira, the city of Safi is known for its seafood specialties. \u2022To most closely approximate the flavor of Moroccan lemons, Wolfert recommends Meyer lemons for this recipe. This lemon/mandarin orange hybrid, in season in January and February, has yellow-orange flesh, a smooth rind, and a sweeter flavor than other lemons. \u2022To sterilize a mason jar for the lemons, place it upside down in a steamer and steam for 10 minutes. Using tongs (wrap the ends in rubber bands for a better grip), remove the hot jar and dry it upside down on a paper towel-lined baking sheet in a warm oven. To sterilize the jar's top, boil it in water for 5 minutes, then remove with tongs.

This way, the remaining contents of the jar will not need to be refrigerated."

    "instructions": "Place pork shoulder on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with 1 tablespoon each kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F.\nHeat a large heavy pot (such as a Dutch oven) over high; add 1/4 cup oil, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to sizzle; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, herbs, and spices and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute more. Add the wine and bring to a simmer.\nPlace the pork on top of the aromatics and add enough stock or water to come halfway up the pork. Bring liquid to a simmer, and then cover pot with a lid or a couple layers of foil.\nTransfer pot to oven and cook for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 325\u00b0F and cook until the meat is quite tender, about 3 hours. (To test for doneness, insert a slender, sharp knife into the middle of the roast; it should pull out easily.)\nWhen meat is cooked, transfer it to a separate container, reserving the pan juices. Set a colander over a large bowl, and strain the pan juice into the bowl, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid. Let strained pan juices until fat rises to the top, about 5 minutes. With a small ladle, skim off and discard the fat. Pour the skimmed, strained pan juices over the pork and let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate overnight.\nOne hour before you're ready to serve the pork, remove the meat from its cooking liquid and cut (while still cold) into neat 1-inch slices; set aside. Pour cooking liquid in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer and reduce by a third. Season to taste, cover, and keep warm.\nWhile your pork comes to room temperature, prepare the salsa verde. Line a large plate with a paper towel, and place it next to the stove, alongside a slotted spoon or \"spider\" spatula. In a small skillet, heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat. When the oil starts to look swirly, drop in a single rosemary leaf to test for readiness: if it sinks quietly to the bottom, the oil's not ready. When a leaf sizzles, but not in a frantic way, you are ready to fry.\nAdd the rosemary leaves to the oil and fry until the sizzling subsides, about 1 minute. Using the slotted spoon or spider, scoop the herbs from the oil and place the on the paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the sage leaves in the same oil; remove skillet from heat.\nOn a cutting board, gather the parsley leaves into a ball, holding them down on the cutting board as if they were trying to run away. Slice this parsley bundle thinly, as if it were a single vegetable. As you slice, the ball will come apart, but just bunch it back together as best you can, keep slicing, and you'll have a nice head start on the chopping that remains. Anchor the tip of the knife to the cutting board and use a paper cutter-like motion to chop away at your pile. Go over it a couple of times, then slide the knife under, like a spatula, and flip it over. Continue chopping and flipping until the parsley is finely chopped; transfer to a medium bowl.\nRender the garlic a paste by either pounding it in a mortar with a pinch of salt, or with a knife on a cutting board, again with salt. When the garlic is almost a thick liquid, transfer it the bowl with the parsley; add the fried herbs and the olive oil. Stir salsa verde to combine, adding more salt or oil as needed.\nHeat a grill, grill pan, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, coat the grill or pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook until well browned and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.\nPour the reduced pan juices onto a serving platter with the pork (but not over the slices or they will lose some crispness) and arrange pork slices on top. Serve with salsa verde spooned over the top, or served alongside."

    "instructions": "Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add butter and olive oil to a large saut\u00e9 pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saut\u00e9 until most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.\nTie the tenderloin in four places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with oil, then season with salt and pepper. Heat a large, heavy-based skillet over medium-high heat and lightly coat with oil. Sear the beef all over, including the ends, until dark brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula, evenly cover the prosciutto with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with thyme leaves.\nWhen the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets, you may have to overlap two sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef, saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.\nBrush the top of the pastry with egg wash, then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife. Doing this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes before cutting into thick slices. Garnish with minced chives, and serve with Green Peppercorn Sauce, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, and Warm Wilted Winter Greens.\nAdd olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saut\u00e9 for 1 to 2 minutes, then, off heat, add brandy and flamb\u00e9 using a long kitchen match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by about half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard.

    ],
    "instructions": "Using wood chips in a gas grill is very easy but takes a little planning. If your grill has a smoker attachment, follow the manufacturer's instructions and fill it with wood chips that have been soaked in water or other non-flammable liquid for 30 minutes. If you don't have a smoker box, follow these simple instructions: Fill a small disposable aluminum pan with soaked wood chips, remove the cooking grate, and place the pan in the upper left corner of the grill, or at the spot where all the burners come together. The pan of wood chips will be resting directly on the ceramic briquettes, flavorizerbars, or lava rocks.\nPreheat the grill with all the burners on high until smoke begins to appear around the edges of the grill. At this time, set the grill for indirect cooking (turn the burners that will be directly under the food off) and turn the other burners down to medium-low heat. Immediately place the food in the center of the cooking grate and close the lid of the grill to retain the heat and the smoke. You won't need to add more chips, as one panful is enough to impart a nice smoky flavor to the food.\nNote: It is essential that you put the soaked wood chips in a gas grill during the preheat stage. Once you set the burners for indirect heat, there won't be enough heat to smolder the chips. Likewise, if you don't soak the chips, they will ignite and burn, not smoke.\nUsing wood chips on a charcoal grill is much simpler than a gas grill. There is no special equipment necessary; all you do is soak the chips and put a handful directly on top of the white-gray ashed briquettes. To set up a charcoal grill for indirect cooking, place two equal piles of ashed briquettes on each side of the grill, separated by an aluminum pan filled with a bit of water. If you want just a hint of smoke, only use one handful of chips. If you want a more pronounced smoke flavor, add a handful or two more, but be careful: Too much smoke will turn the meat acrid and your food will taste more like ashes than smoke.\nNote: There is a barbecue contingent that believes that smoke dehydrates the cooking chamber and steals moisture from the meat. To prevent any loss of moisture, I usually add some liquid in an aluminum pan to both charcoal and gas grills. After all, it can't hurt and we all know that steam does tenderize and cook food.\nRemove and discard excess fat from the turkey. Rinse the bird and pat dry. Twist the wing tips under the back. Brush the turkey with oil and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper inside and out. If you brined your bird, skip the salt and pepper.\nIf using a gas grill, place the turkey on a roasting rack set in a disposable aluminum-foil roasting pan and place in the grill over the unlit burners. Bend the roasting pan to accommodate closing the gas grill.\nIf using a charcoal grill, set an aluminum pan filled with 2 inches water on the charcoal grate directly under where the turkey will smoke. Place the turkey, breast?side-up, directly on the cooking grate above the pan. Add wet wood chips directly to the gray-ashed charcoal briquettes. Place the lid on the grill and adjust the vents so that two-thirds of them are closed on the bottom and the top.\nCook over indirect heat without lifting the lid for at least 40 minutes to get good smoke on the turkey. Add more wet wood chips to the smoker box or to the charcoal as desired. After a total of 1 1/2 hours, you won't need to add any more wood, as the turkey will have developed a nice burnished color and \"cooked\" skin. Charcoal grillers will have to add about 12 briquettes to each side every hour; gas grillers don't need to do any tending. No need to baste; the thin coating of oil will promote browning and keep the juices inside the bird.\nWhile the turkey smokes, prepare the glaze. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the hot pepper jelly, stirring occasionally so it doesn't burn. When the jelly is melted, stir in the vinegar to combine. Add the salt and red pepper flakes, if using. If the glaze is too thick, add a bit more vinegar. Taste and adjust seasonings.\nCook the turkey for 12 minutes per pound total, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (not touching bone) registers 165\u00b0F and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced. Brush the smoked turkey with the glaze, cover, and cook for 15 minutes more. Transfer to a serving platter and let rest for at least 20 minutes before carving and serving."

Lightly salt the zucchini with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and set aside for 15 minutes. Blot the zucchini with paper towels.\nPreheat a grill to medium heat (or preheat a grill pan over medium heat).\nOil the grill grates or spray the grill pan with cooking spray to avoid sticking. Grill the zucchini until cooked and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels and press to absorb excess moisture.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, and egg.

Finish the lasagna by topping with the remaining zucchini and meat sauce. Cover the dish with foil.\nBake for 30 minutes, remove the foil, and bake 20 minutes uncovered. Add the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and bake uncovered until bubbling and the cheese is melted, 10 more minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into 8 pieces."

After two hours, check liquid levels and add more water if necessary. There should be about an inch of liquid at the bottom of the pot at all times.\n7.

Mix together the granulated sugar and 1 cup of the salt in a bowl, then rub the mixture into the meat; discard any excess salt-and-sugar mixture. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and put it into the fridge for at least 6 hours, or overnight.\n2. Heat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Remove the pork from the refrigerator and discard any juices that have accumulated. Put the pork in the oven and cook for 6 hours, basting with the rendered fat and pan juices every hour. The pork should be tender and yielding at this point\u2014it should offer almost no resistance to the blade of a knife and you should be able to easily pull meat off the shoulder with a fork. Depending on your schedule, you can serve the pork right away or let it rest and mellow out at room temperature for up to an hour.\n3. When ready to serve\u2014sauces are made, oysters are ready to be shucked, lettuce is washed, etc.\u2014turn the oven to 500\u00b0F.\n4. Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon salt and the brown sugar and rub the mixture all over the pork. Put it in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sugar has melted into a crisp, sweet crust.\n5. Serve bo ss\u00e4m whole and hot, surrounded by the accompaniments."

    "instructions": "In a medium bowl, combine the water, tamarind paste, palm or dark brown sugar, fish sauce, and salt and stir until the sugar is dissolved.\nPlace the bean sprouts, limes, and peanuts each in their own small bowl and arrange near the stove. Place the fish sauce, granulated sugar, and crushed red pepper each in their own small bowl and arrange on the dining table.\nBring a 3-quart saucepan of water to a full, rolling boil. Remove it from the heat and immediately add the rice noodles, making sure they are fully submerged in the water. Let the noodles soak for exactly 3 minutes (use a timer), occasionally lifting them up and pulling them apart as necessary with tongs or a long fork to keep the noodles separate and help them soften evenly. Drain the noodles in a large colander and rinse them under cold running water. (If the noodles become sticky and clumped together while standing, rinse them briefly under cold water just before cooking, so that they return to their slippery, firm, toss-able state.)\nIn a small bowl, combine the garlic and shallot. Place the shrimp, beaten eggs, bean sprouts, scallion greens, and peanuts each in their own bowl and arrange near the stove. Have ready 1 clean medium bowl for the cooked shrimp and eggs, and arrange a large plate or platter for serving near the stove.\nHeat a 12-inch heavy, deep skillet or saut\u00e9 pan or a large wok over high heat until hot but not smoking. (If at any point during cooking the oil starts smoking, lower the heat.) Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil is hot, scatter in the shrimp. Cook undisturbed until the shrimp begin to change color and firm up, about 30 seconds. Toss well then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are pink, firm, and just cooked through, about 30 seconds longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to the clean bowl.\nAdd the eggs and swirl the pan to spread them into a thin layer. Cook the eggs, lifting the sides and tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to pour underneath as you would do with an omelet, until the eggs are mostly set, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and use the slotted spoon to quickly cut the eggs into bite-size pieces, then add them to the bowl of shrimp.\nPlace the pan over high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, swirling the pan to coat it evenly (if at any point during cooking the oil starts smoking, lower the heat). Add the garlic and shallot and stir-fry until fragrant, about 5 seconds. Scatter in the softened rice noodles, and, using tongs, evenly spread the noodles out across the pan, like a net. Let them cook undisturbed for 15 seconds then scoop them in toward the center. Toss the noodles gently then spread them out again. Pour about 1/3 of the seasoning sauce around the edges of the pan, and continue stir-frying the noodles in the same manner, spreading them out and letting them cook undisturbed occasionally, until most of the sauce is absorbed, about 30 seconds more.\nAdd another third of the sauce and continue to stir-fry in the same manner until most of the sauce is absorbed and the noodles are just tender but not mushy, about 30 seconds. Test a noodle or two: If they are too firm, add about 2 tablespoons of water around the edge of the pan, and continue stir-frying until they are just tender and evenly coated with the sauce.\nReturn the shrimp and eggs to the pan, along with any juices collected in the bottom of the bowl, and toss to incorporate them into the noodles. Add the remaining third of the seasoning sauce, along with the bean sprouts, scallion greens, and chopped peanuts, and cook, tossing, until they are mixed in and barely heated, about 30 seconds.\nQuickly transfer the noodles to the platter, mounding them at one end. Mound the reserved bean sprouts next to the noodles, and arrange the reserved lime wedges next to the bean sprouts. Sprinkle the peanuts on the noodles in a stripe next to the bean sprouts. Serve hot, passing the small bowls of fish sauce, sugar, and crushed red pepper so that guests can flavor their portions to taste."

Don't worry about the mixture's wetness; mush is what I expect. You can chop everything by hand, though; in which case, don't expect to get everything as ground up as it would in the processor.

(If you're making this in advance, leave it to cool at this stage, then cover and transfer to the refrigerator where it can stand for up to 2 days.)\nWhen you are ready to cook this, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F and let the dressing come to room temperature. Uncover the bowl, beat the eggs and mix them in, then spread the mixture into a foil pan or lightly greased ovenproof dish, and bake for 25\u201330 minutes, until the edges brown and begin to come away from the pan or dish and a cake tester comes out clean.\nFor appetizers, let the pan cool for 30 minutes and then cut into 48 little bite-sized squares\u2014or into 24 larger pieces to accompany roasted meat, if you'd prefer."

This will take about 5 minutes.\nTake the frying pan off the heat and turn the contents into a large bowl, mixing in the steeped cranberries and any Marsala clinging to them, and leave to cool. You can cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for up to 2 days at this stage. When you are ready to stuff the turkey breast, take the bowl of sausage meat out of the refrigerator.\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\nUncover the bowl of sausage meat, add the eggs, Parmesan, and bread crumbs and\u2014I use my hands for this\u2014mix well. Lay the butterflied turkey joint out in front of you. It really does look like a butterfly, though admittedly a fleshy one. Spread the stuffing out first in the slight cavity in the center of the butterfly and then outward onto the wings though not going right up to the edge (or it will squidge out when cooking) but as evenly as possible over the whole joint.\nCarefully, in one swift but steady movement, fold one \"wing\" over the other to close the joint, and then sit the turkey in a large roasting pan, breast bone (or where the breast bone would be) on top as it would look were it the whole bird, with the pointier bit farthest away from you. Thread 2 skewers through the base\u2014i.e., the widest part that is nearer you\u2014to keep it closed, and smear it all over with the duck or goose fat.\nRoast the turkey breast for 2\u20132 1/2 hours, then check it is cooked with a turkey or meat thermometer. When cooked, it should read 165\u00b0F in the center. (If you're leaving it to rest, as you should, or to cool, you could take it out at 160\u00b0F\u2014it will retain heat and continue to cook for a short while once out of the oven.)\nFlex your muscles, then lift out onto a cutting board, and leave to rest for at least 20 minutes. Or leave to get cold if you are eating it as part of a cook-ahead buffet.\nCut through the whole joint in wide slices right across; they will need to be quite thick, at least 1/2 inch, maybe 1 inch, to keep the stuffing intact within the slice.\nAs you place it on table or sideboard, dot around it the condiments of your choice: I revert to Christmas in Italy here by putting a lusciously extravagant pot or two of Italian mostarda di Cremona on the table alongside: this is a hot and sweet preserve of mustardy candied fruits that gleam beautifully and taste both festive and fabulous."

Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and allow to infuse for 20 minutes.\n2. Strain the milk mixture and return it to the saucepan. Reheat until the mixture just begins to boil. Remove from the heat.\n3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar vigorously until pale. Whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the yolks, then return this mixture to the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon and reaches 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer; do not let the mixture boil, or the egg yolks will curdle. Remove the pot from the heat. Pass the ice cream base through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Set the bowl in an ice bath and stir frequently until cold. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the ice cream base for at least 4 hours.\n4. Process the base in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions (be careful not to overchurn the ice cream or it will become grainy). Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.\n1. In a medium saucepan, bring the pomegranate juice and black pepper to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the pears and reduce the heat to medium-low. Poach the pears in the simmering juice until tender, about 15 minutes. Cool completely at room temperature.\n2. Transfer the pears, still in the liquid, to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to serve.\nPour the poaching liquid in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue to boil the liquid until it has reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Pass the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and cool.\n1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.\n2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter and sugar on medium speed until creamy and well blended, about 2 minutes. Add the almond flour and mix until blended. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the flour and mix until blended. Scrape the almond mixture into the prepared pan, smoothing it into an even layer. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until golden brown. Place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely.\n3. Using a 2-inch-long by 1-inch-wide diamond-shaped pastry cutter, cut out 8 diamonds of baked almond cream. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.\nCut each Poached Pear with Pomegranate in half crosswise and remove the cores from the bottom halves. Place each pear bottom standing up on a plate and top with a slice of Cabrales cheese. Replace the pear tops. Glaze the pears with some of the Pomegranate Sauce, letting some of the sauce drip onto the plates. Place a Baked Almond Diamond on each plate and top with a scoop of Szechuan Pepper Ice Cream."

You may have to do this in batches. When the breasts are cooked, set them aside skin side up on a cutting board and let them rest, tented with aluminum foil, while you make the sauce.\nTo make the sauce, pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and place the pan over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour into the pan and stir to combine and make a roux. Let it cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until it is the color of coffee with cream.\nAdd a pinch of salt and stir to combine, then slowly stir in the stock, orange juice, liqueur, and vinegar. Everything will spatter at first, but it will calm down. Add any accumulated juices from the duck to the sauce. Let this boil down until it is a little thinner than the consistency of Thanksgiving gravy. Add the sugar, then taste and adjust with salt. If you want a more refined sauce, pour it through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.\nTo serve, slice the breasts. Spoon some sauce on each plate and top with breast slices. Garnish with the orange zest and orange slices."

(The gumbo should have the consistency of chowder. If it thickens too much as it simmers, add additional stock; if it's too thin, in a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour and 3 tablespoons canola oil and gradually add this mixture to the gumbo, simmering the mixture for a few minutes between additions, until the desired consistency is reached.) Add the turkey meat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the turkey is heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve hot. DO AHEAD: The gumbo can be prepared ahead and kept, covered in the refrigerator, up to 3 days, or frozen, in an airtight container, up to 3 months. To reheat: Warm the gumbo in a heavy pot over moderate heat, adding additional chicken stock as needed to adjust the consistency."

Add the onion, bell pepper, piquillos, garlic, tomatoes, Espelette, and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until the onion begins to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to caramelize, 3 to 4 minutes.\n3. Add the rice, Saz\u00f3n, and saffron and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and nestle the chicken thighs skin side up in the rice. (Try not to submerge the skin, so it stays crisp as the rice cooks.) Cook, partially covered, until the rice has absorbed the liquid and the chicken is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. If the chicken skin is not crisp, place the pan under a hot broiler until the chicken is crispy and golden brown on top.\n4. To serve, remove the bay leaves, sprinkle the cilantro and parsley over the rice, and gently stir to incorporate. Serve directly from the pan, with the yogurt sprinkled with lime zest and the bottle of hot sauce on the side."

Cover and let sit at room temperature at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. For the tare, combine soy sauce, sake, and mirin in a small bowl; cover and chill.\nPREP PORK SHOULDER Season pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Roll up and tie with kitchen twine at 2\" intervals. (This helps keep the meat intact while cooking and makes for round, compact slices.)\nCOOK PORK SHOULDER AND MAKE STOCK Heat oil in a large heavy pot (at least 8 quarts) over medium-high heat. Cook pork shoulder, turning, until brown all over, 10-12 minutes. Add chicken, spareribs, scallions, carrots, garlic, ginger, and bonito flakes. Remove kombu from dashi; discard. Add as much kombu dashi as will fit in pot once liquid is boiling (reserve remaining dashi). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally and adding remaining dashi as liquid reduces, until pork shoulder is tender and stock has reduced to about 2 quarts, 2 1/2-3 hours.\nCHILL PORK SHOULDER AND STOCK Remove pork shoulder from stock and let cool. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill until ready to use. (Chilling pork will make meat easier to slice.) Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into another large pot or a large bowl or container; discard solids (including ribs and chicken). Cover and chill.\nCOOK EGGS Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Carefully add eggs one at a time and boil gently for 7 minutes. Egg yolks should be shiny yellow and almost jammy; egg white should be just set. Drain eggs and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking; let cool. Peel; set aside. (Eggs can be cooked 1 day ahead. Keep unpeeled eggs covered in cool water. Cover and chill.)\nSLICE PORK Remove string and thinly slice pork; cover and set aside.\nREHEAT STOCK AND COOK NOODLES When ready to serve, bring stock to a simmer; it should be very hot.\nAt the same time, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions until al dente; drain (no need to salt the water, as ramen noodles contain more salt than pasta).\nPUT IT ALL TOGETHER Divide noodles among 6 deep bowls.\nTop with sliced pork, placing it off to one side. Add tare to hot stock and ladle over pork to warm through (stock should come up just to the level of the noodles).\nPlace a small pile of menma next to pork. Halve eggs and place next to menma.\nPlace a small pile of sliced scallions next to egg. Tuck half a sheet of nori between side of bowl and noodles so it's just poking out.\nServe ramen with chili oil, sesame oil, and shichimi togarashi."

DO AHEAD: To develop maximum flavor, place the ribs, coated in the rub, in the refrigerator and chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\nLine a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. If you have a flat metal cooling rack, arrange it in the baking sheet and place the ribs, bone side down, on the rack. If you don't have a rack, place the ribs, bone side down, directly on the foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the ribs until the meat is tender and starting to pull away from the bones, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. At this point, the ribs are ready to be served, but we recommend taking the time to finish them on the grill (or in the broiler), while glazing with homemade barbecue sauce. DO AHEAD: Ribs can be baked ahead of time and kept, wrapped in foil, at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours, before finishing them on the grill.\nIn a heavy, medium saucepan over moderately low heat, cook the bacon until the fat renders and the bacon starts to brown, about 10 minutes\u2014do not let the bacon get crispy. Add the onions and continue cooking, covered and stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Add the smoked paprika, chile powder, cumin, black pepper, and ginger and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the coffee, brown sugar, yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar and stir well to combine. Raise the heat to moderate and bring the sauce to a boil, scraping the saucepan with a wooden spoon to remove any browned bits from the bottom. Add the ketchup, hot sauce, and bay leaves, then lower the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce until it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but isn't as thick as ketchup, about 30 minutes. Taste the sauce and add more vinegar or hot sauce to taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove and discard the bay leaves. DO AHEAD: BBQ sauce can be made ahead and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks. Warm the sauce gently on the stove before using.\nWhile the barbecue sauce is simmering, prepare your grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat: If using a charcoal grill, open the vents on the bottom of the grill and light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When the coals are covered with white-gray ash (about 20 to 30 minutes later), spread them out on the grill's bottom rack, leaving a space to one side that is equal to the size of the food to be grilled so that it can be moved there in the case of flare-ups. Test the heat of the charcoal by holding your hand 5 inches above the coals for about 3 seconds for medium-high heat. If the charcoal is too hot, continue to let it burn until it reaches medium-high.\nIf using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, covered, for 10 minutes, then adjust the heat to medium-high.\nDepending on the size of your grill, place 1 or 2 slabs, bone side down, over the heat and brush the fat-covered side generously with barbecue sauce. Grill the ribs, covered, for 2 minutes. Flip the slab over, brush the bone side with sauce, and grill, covered, until the sauce on the fat-covered side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the slab over and continue grilling, covered, until the sauce on the bone side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 minute. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes. If necessary, repeat the grilling and glazing process with the second slab of ribs. Cut between the ribs and serve immediately with plenty of barbecue sauce on the side."

Add your chicken pieces and about a quarter of the sauce and cook for 5 minutes without stirring. Then toss the chicken pieces, doing your best to flip them over, adding another quarter of the sauce. Cook until the inside of the meat is white, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nRemove the chicken from the heat and allow it to rest until the pieces are cool enough to handle. Weave the chicken onto the bamboo skewers, about 4 per skewer, and lay them flat on a serving dish or a large plate.

      "a smoker box",
      "a grill or analog thermometer we recommend it even if your grill has one"
    ],
    "instructions": "1 Order the brisket You'll have to special-order your brisket ahead of time (the brisket already sold at the meat counter is typically not whole). You should be able to do this at almost any butcher shop or at a grocery store meat counter. Ask for a brisket that is as evenly thick as possible, with the surrounding fat trimmed to 1/4\" thick (this protects the meat from drying out while cooking).\n2 Season the meat An hour before preparing the grill, place brisket on a rimmed baking sheet. Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl and season the meat all over (it should look like sand stuck to wet skin but without being cakey). Let meat sit at room temperature for 1 hour.\n3 Prepare your grill Meanwhile, soak 6 cups wood chips in a bowl of water for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Leave in water throughout the cooking process. Keep remaining 2 cups chips dry. Light only 1 grill burner to medium (if using a 3-burner grill, light burner on either end). Make sure drip tray is empty, as a lot of fat will render. Place smoker box over the lit burner, add 1/2 cup soaked wood chips to box, and close grill. Adjust heat as needed to keep temperature at 225-250\u00b0F. We recommend using a stand-alone thermometer, even if your grill has one, to ensure an accurate reading. Stick it through the gap between the lid and base of the grill (or set it on the grill's upper shelf, though this is not ideal, as it requires opening the lid more frequently). The wood chips should begin to smolder and release a steady stream of smoke. How long this takes depends on how wet your chips are and the heat of your grill. To get more smoke without increasing grill heat, add a few dry chips to the soaked ones.\n4 Maintain the heat Place brisket, fatty side up, on grill grate as far away from lit burner as possible. Cover grill and smoke meat, resisting the urge to open grill often, as this will cause the temperature to fluctuate. Adjust heat as needed to keep temperature steady at 225-250\u00b0F. Check wood chips every 45 minutes or so, and add soaked chips by 1/2-cupfuls as needed to keep smoke level constant.\n5 Know when it's done Keep smoking the brisket, rotating every 3 hours and flipping as needed if top or bottom is coloring faster than the other, until meat is very tender but not falling apart and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of meat registers 195-205\u00b0F, 10-12 hours total.*\n*Need a cheat? If you just don't want to spend your whole day at the grill, here's a fail-safe, Aaron Franklin- endorsed alternate method that will deliver similarly glorious results: Smoke brisket on grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of meat registers 150-170\u00b0F, 5-6 hours. Wrap brisket in foil, place on a baking sheet, and cook in a 250\u00b0F oven until meat reaches the same 195-205\u00b0F internal temperature, 4-6 hours longer. What's important is getting that smoky flavor into the meat, and 5-6 hours on the grill should do it. After that point, you're simply getting the meat cooked through.\nDO AHEAD: Brisket is best shortly off the grill, but you can still get good results smoking it up to 3 days ahead. Let cool for an hour before wrapping in foil and chilling. To serve, reheat meat, still wrapped, in a 325\u00b0F oven until warmed through.\n6 Dig in Transfer brisket to a carving board and let rest at least 30 minutes. Slice brisket against the grain 1/4\" thick.\nServe it with: Coleslaw, potato salad, and pinto beans."

Continue to coat and fry the remaining chicken in the same manner, returning the oil to 365\u00b0F between batches.\nOnce the chicken is fried, place the skillet of reserved orange sauce over moderately low heat and bring it to a simmer, stirring and thinning the sauce with a little water if necessary. Add the chicken, and stir until thoroughly coated in sauce.\nTransfer the chicken to a serving dish and garnish with the scallions, and, if desired, the red chile slices and the freshly grated orange zest.

Fry each side until golden brown and softened, which should be about 3 minutes per side. When all the slices are cooked, set them aside.\nWash the spinach well in cold running water, then toss it in a hot medium saucepan (using just the water that is clinging to the leaves) until wilted, and drain off the excess liquid.\nNow, assemble each wrap by taking 1 slice of the cooked eggplant and placing a little of the wilted spinach on one side. Then lay a piece of sundried tomato on top, sprinkle a few toasted pine nuts over it, and top with a slice of Cheddar. Fold the eggplant over to form the wrap, then place it on a large non-stick baking sheet.\nRepeat this until all 16 wraps are assembled and placed side by side on the baking sheet. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and a grind of fresh black pepper.\nBake in the oven for 15 minutes, until the cheese has melted and is bubbling, and serve immediately."

Increase the heat, add the livers, and stir for a few seconds so that they absorb the flavor of the onion. Either pour the mixture into a food processor and process to a coarse or smooth paste with the gribenes (if using), or pass the mixture through an old-fashioned grinder. Scoop into a bowl. Grate the eggs on the coarse side of a grater and add to the bowl, reserving a little of the grated egg for the garnish. Stir in the parsley and fold in gently. Moisten the mixture with some wine, brandy, or chicken stock, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until needed. Serve in scoops on individual plates topped with a little grated egg and paprika for color, and generous pieces of fresh Friday-night challah.\nRemove the spare fat from a raw chicken and place in a pan. (There is usually a lump of fat around the neck, in an older bird at least.) Add 1 cup (8 oz) dairy-free margarine, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 large onion (with the skin left on to enhance the golden color). Remove the skin from the chicken, cut into smallish pieces, and add to the pan. Set over very low heat and cook for 1 1/2-2 hours until all of the fat has been rendered gently out of the chicken skin. Remove the skin from the pan and drain on paper towels to form gribenes or crackling. Pour the fat (schmaltz) into a heavy-duty glass dish and store in the fridge until needed*. As the fat cools, a rich jelly will collect at the bottom of the dish. This jelly forms a delicious base for soup or sauces.\nThe fat (schmaltz) will keep for up to 6 weeks in the fridge. Store the gribenes in the fridge."

Lay the halved tomatillos cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet or metal baking pan and slide onto the grill. Brush the ramps (or green onions or garlic chives) with oil. Lay them directly on the grill, along with the chile (no oil needed). Grill the ramps (or their stand-ins) and the chile, turning occasionally, until soft and richly browned-the ramps will take 4 to 5 minutes, the chile about 10.\nCook the tomatillos about 3 to 4 minutes, until soft and browned on one side, then flip them over and cook the other side. Cool everything. Finely chop the ramps (etc.) and chile, then scrape into a large bowl. Chop the tomatillo into small pieces and scrape them in with the ramps, then scrape in any juice that remains on the baking sheet.\nWhile the grilled vegetables are cooling, cook the bacon in a single layer in a large skillet over medium heat, turning every once in a while, until browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then chop into small pieces.\nCut the avocados in half, running a knife around the pit from top to bottom and back up again. Twist the halves in opposite directions to release the pit from one side of each avocado. Remove the pit, then scoop the flesh from each half into the bowl with the tomatillos. With an old-fashioned potato masher, a large fork or the back of a large spoon, coarsely mash the avocado with the tomatillo mixture. Stir in the lime juice, cilantro and half of the bacon. Taste and season with salt, usually about 1 teaspoon. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the guacamole and refrigerate until you're ready to serve.\nWhen that time comes, scrape the guacamole into a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining bacon. Garnish with cilantro leaves."

Reserve 1 strip for another use. Cut each remaining strip into 3 squares for a total of 6. Place a square in each muffin cup, pressing into bottom and up sides and leaving corners pointing up. Divide filling among cups. Fold pastry over filling, pressing corners together to meet in center. DO AHEAD: Spinach puffs can be assembled 3 hours ahead. Cover puffs and chill.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Beat remaining egg to blend in a small bowl. Brush pastry with egg wash (this will give the pastry a nice sheen). Bake until pastry is golden brown and puffed, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let puffs cool in pan for 10 minutes. Run a sharp paring knife around pan edges to loosen; turn out puffs onto rack to cool slightly before serving."

    "instructions": "1. Make the stock: to ensure the pot is large enough to blanch the bones without boiling over, put the bones in the pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Then remove the bones and set aside.\n2. Bring the water to a boil. When it is at a rolling boil, add the oxtails, beef shank, and pork bones. Return the water to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Drain the bones into a colander and rinse under cold running water. Rinse the pot and return the rinsed oxtails, neck bones, and shanks to the pot. Add the marrowbones and brisket.\n3. Cut off the pale, fleshy part (the bottom 4 inches) of each lemongrass stalk and discard the leafy tops. Crush the lemongrass with the side of a cleaver or the bottom of a heavy pan and add it to the pot. Add 8 quarts fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the liquid is at a simmer and skim off any scum that rises to the surface.\n4. After 45 minutes, ready an ice-water bath, then check the brisket for doneness by using the chopstick test: transfer the brisket to a plate and poke it with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. If they do not, return the brisket to the pot and continue cooking, checking again in 10 minutes. When the brisket is done, remove it from the pot (reserving the cooking liquid) and immediately submerge it in the ice-water bath, which will stop the cooking and give the meat a firmer texture. When the brisket is completely cool, remove from the water, pat dry, and refrigerate.\n5. Continue to simmer the stock for another 2 hours, skimming as needed to remove any scum that forms on the surface. Remove from the heat and remove and discard the large solids. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the stock (leave some, as it gives the stock a better flavor and mouthfeel). Return the stock to a simmer over medium heat.\n6. In a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder. In a frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ground red pepper flakes and annatto seeds and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds. Add the shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and shrimp paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more, until the mixture is aromatic and the shallots are just beginning to soften.\n7. Add the contents of the frying pan to the simmering stock along with the salt and sugar and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and sugar.\n8. To ready the garnishes, arrange the basil, perilla, cabbage, lemon and lime wedges, and onion slices on a platter and place on the table. Thinly slice the brisket against the grain. Divide the cooked noodles among warmed soup bowls, then divide the brisket slices evenly among the bowls, placing them on top of the noodles. Ladle the hot stock over the noodles and beef and serve immediately, accompanied with the platter of garnishes."

(The pork can also be refrigerated overnight. Bring meat to room temperature before grilling).\n2. Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal grill (you should be able to hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the grate for only 2 to 3 seconds). When the coals are ready, push two-thirds of the coals to one-half of the grill, creating a hot zone; spread the remaining one-third on the opposite side of the grill to create a cooler zone.\n3. Remove the pork chops from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chops on the hottest part of the grill. Let cook for 1 minute, then flip and cook for 1 minute on the second side.\n4. Move the chops to the cooler side of the grill and cook, turning once, for about 10 minutes total, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chop registers 140\u00b0F, raking over coals from the hotter side of the grill if necessary to maintain an even temperature. Spritz any flare-ups with a spray bottle filled with water.\n5. Transfer the chops to a large plate, tent with aluminum foil, and let stand for 10 minutes. Cut the meat from the bone and slice the meat across the grain on the diagonal. Transfer the slices and bones to a serving platter and serve."

Let soak for at least 20 minutes.\nGrind the cumin, cloves, allspice, oregano, and dried thyme (if using) together in an electric coffee or spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle.\nDrain the soaked chiles. Working in batches as necessary, place them in a blender with the ground herbs and spices (add fresh thyme at this point if using), garlic, onion, vinegar, salt, and about 1/2 cup water (or enough to facilitate the action of the blades). Process to a smooth pur\u00e9e (about 3 minutes on high), stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. With a wooden spoon or pusher, for the pur\u00e9e through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. It should have the consistency of a thick but still moist paste.\nSeason the pieces of goat or lamb with salt and pepper. Slather the seasoning paste all over the meat. Arrange in a large bowl (or any non-reactive container that's large enough), cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator about 2 hours before beginning the cooking, to let the meat come to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\nChoose a deep roasting pan or baking dish large enough to hold the meat snugly. Scatter half of the avocado leaves across the bottom of the pan and arrange the meat on them. Scatter the remaining leaves over the meat. Cover the pan (wrapping very tightly with several layers of foil if there is no lid) and bake 6 to 7 hours (4 to 4 1/2 hours for the lamb). The meat should be almost falling off the bone."

Set aside at room temperature.\nBuild a hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to high. Using a grill brush, scrape the heated grill rack clean. Rub the rack with oil. Arrange the meatballs on the grill rack without crowding. Using tongs, grill until browned evenly on all sides and cooked to medium, 8-10 minutes total, depending on grill temperature. Move any meatballs to a cooler area of the grill if they threaten to overbrown. Transfer to a platter or clean baking sheet as they are finished. Let rest for 5 minutes while you assemble the sandwiches.\nCut the baguette crosswise into fourths and split each piece horizontally. Lay the pieces, cut side down, on the grill. Toast until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Lay the provolone slices on half of the baguette pieces. Place 3 meatballs on top of the cheese-lined baguette slices. Garnish with the pesto and serve right away."

Knead by hand until all the ingredients are well combined and the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, place all the ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. With the mixer on medium speed, knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it in a covered bowl and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.\n2. Set up a pasta machine and turn it to the largest opening. Cut off pieces of dough about the size of an egg. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll the dough into sheets about 1/8-inch thick.\n3. Lay 1 pasta sheet flat on a lightly floured work surface and determine approximately where the halfway point is lengthwise. Use a pastry brush to lightly wet one half of the dough with the remaining egg lightly beaten with water. Spoon mounds of the filling, about 2 teaspoons each, onto half of the wet side of the dough, leaving about a 1/2 inch between the mounds. Fold the dry half of the sheet over lengthwise to cover the filling. Press the pasta sheets together to seal the edges around the filling, and press out any excess air. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut individual ravioli. As you cut out the ravioli, place them on a plate or baking sheet sprinkled with flour to keep them from sticking. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling.\n4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli all at once and stir a few times to submerge and separate them. Cook, uncovered, at a gentle boil until the pasta is just tender to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the ravioli thoroughly and serve with a desired sauce or cheese."

When the gazpacho is chilled, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season the scallops generously with salt and pepper. Once the olive oil slips easily across the pan, carefully place the scallops in the pan and sear until golden brown. I like the scallops to be just barely cooked, so I only sear one side. After about 2 minutes on the stovetop, put the whole kit and caboodle in the oven, without flipping the scallops; they will need 2-3 minutes in the oven.\nFill each chilled soup bowl with a generous portion of gazpacho and nestle one scallop in each bowl, seared side up. A sprinkling of Espelette pepper and the thyme sprigs and blossoms and a drizzle of fruity olive oil is all you need."

Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then put the solids through a meat grinder set on coarse grind. (You can also chop with a knife if you don't have a meat grinder, which is what I usually do anyway.)\nPlace the ground meat in a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in the cooked rice, parsley, scallions, and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes. When the boudin-rice mixture is first combined, it looks very wet and it's pretty spicy. Don't worry; after poaching, the rice absorbs the excess moisture and much of the spice. The wet texture and extra spice ensure that your final boudin will be moist and full of flavor.\nAt this point you can feed the sausage into the casings. Poach the links gently in hot (not bubbling) water for about 10 minutes, then serve. Alternatively, you can use the mixture as a stuffing for chicken, or roll it into \"boudin balls,\" dredge in bread crumbs, and fry in hot oil until golden brown."

Spread 1 1/2 cups stuffing over each, leaving a 1\" border on all sides. (Place remaining stuffing in a small baking dish; bake with veal during last 30 minutes of roasting). Roll veal into cylinders and tie crosswise with kitchen twine at 1\" intervals.\nHeat oil in a heavy pot large enough to hold both veal breasts over medium-high heat. Add veal to pot and cook until browned on all sides, 5-7 minutes. Transfer veal to a large plate.\nAdd remaining reserved porcini from stuffing, leeks, carrots, celery, and onion to pot. Add remaining 2 teaspoons paprika and 1 teaspoon sage; season with salt and pepper and stir to coat. Add wine, broth, and any remaining porcini soaking liquid. Boil for 2 minutes. Add veal. (Liquid should come halfway up sides of veal; add more broth if necessary).\nCover, transfer to oven, and cook, basting and rotating veal every hour, until very tender, 2 1/2-3 hours, depending on thickness of veal. Transfer veal breasts to a carving board; tent loosely with foil.\nMeanwhile, spoon fat from surface of sauce. Strain sauce into a saucepan. Transfer vegetables to a blender; pur\u00e9e until smooth, adding some sauce as necessary. Add 2 cups pur\u00e9ed vegetables to sauce in pan. Simmer over medium-high heat until reduced to 4 cups, 8-10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside 3 cups for veal and reserve the remaining 1 cup sauce for another use.\nSlice veal into 3/4\"-1\"-thick slices and serve with sauce."

Add the sugar and vinegar and continue cooking until amber in color and thickened to the consistency of molasses, about 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: The shallots can be made in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 3 days.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil and keep at a bare simmer. Fill a large bowl with very cold ice water.\nIn a second large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and pepper.\nIn a blender, combine the eggs, sour cream, and 1 cup water. Pur\u00e9e until smooth then add to the flour mixture and stir to combine (the consistency should be a little thicker than pancake batter, so adjust with more flour or more water as needed).\nWorking over barely simmering water, force half the batter through a spaetzlemaker, food mill, or colander. Let the spaetzle float to the surface\u2014this will take about 1 minute\u2014wait 30 seconds, then use a mesh skimmer or slotted spoon and transfer the spaetzle to the bowl of ice water. Once cool, transfer the spaetzle to a colander to drain. Repeat with the remaining batter. DO AHEAD: Spaetzle can be made in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 2 days.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and pepper. The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche should have an intense pepper note, so add more pepper to taste if necessary. DO AHEAD: The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche can be made in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 1 day.\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan over moderately high heat, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add 1/2 the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 the garlic, shallots, and thyme and continue saut\u00e9ing until the shallots are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of vinegar and continue cooking until the vinegar is almost completely evaporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, shallots, thyme, and vinegar. Once all the mushrooms are saut\u00e9ed, reserve about 1/2 cup. Transfer the remaining mushrooms to a blender, add the beef stock, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. With the blender on, slowly add the grapeseed oil and truffle oil, if using, and continue processing until the sauce is smooth, aerated, and emulsified, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a splash of vinegar if necessary.\nSeason the steaks with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, heat the olive oil until hot but not smoking. Cook the steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board as done and tent with foil. Let rest for about 5 minutes before serving.\nIn a small saucepan over low heat, warm the mushroom pur\u00e9e. When warm, transfer to a gravy boat or other serving dish.\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan over moderately high heat, melt the butter. Add 1/2 of the spaetzle and saut\u00e9 without stirring until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining spaetzle, the reserved 1/2 cup of mushrooms, and the shallot marmalade and saut\u00e9 until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a serving dish.\nThinly slice the steaks and arrange the meat on a small platter. Dollop the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche over the meat and sprinkle with the dill. Serve immediately."

    "instructions": "With a stovetop burner set to high, use tongs to hold each chile about 3 inches from the flame and toast until slightly puffed and aromatic, about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining chiles, transferring them to a large bowl as toasted. Cover the chiles with about 1 quart boiling water. (If the chiles float, puncture each with a small knife to let the water inside.) Steep the chiles until soft and pliable, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool. Once the chiles are cool enough to handle, remove the stems and most of the seeds and transfer to a blender or the bowl of a food processor.\nWhile the chiles are soaking, arrange a rack about 6 inches from the flame and preheat the broiler. Arrange the tomatoes on the broiler pan or a baking sheet and broil, flipping several times to expose all sides, until the entire surface is charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Let the tomatoes cool slightly then remove and discard the charred skin. Add the tomato flesh to the chiles in the blender or food processor. Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, cloves, and 1 cup water and process until smooth.\nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 300\u00b0F. Cut a piece of parchment into a round the same size as a large Dutch oven.\nSeason the meat with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over moderate heat, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, sear the meat until brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. As browned, transfer the meat to a plate.\nOnce all of the meat is seared, return it all to the pot and add the reserved chile-tomato pur\u00e9e. Bring to a boil and then place the parchment round over the meat. Cover the pot with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender and falling apart, about 3 hours. Discard the parchment then transfer the meat to a cutting board and use two forks to shred it into small pieces, discarding any excess fat. Skim any excess fat from the braising liquid then return the meat to the pot and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: The brisket can be made ahead and stored with its braising liquid, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 3 days. To reheat, place the desired portion in an appropriate-size skillet over moderate heat and cook until warmed through.\nDivide the pulled brisket evenly among the buns (about 2 tablespoons per bun) and serve immediately."

It just seems that this burger is too healthy to fry. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C, or gas mark 4) and line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat.

Set aside at room temperature.\n2. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for indirect grilling over medium heat; the temperature inside the grill should be 350\u00b0\u2014375\u00b0F (180\u00b0\u2014190\u00b0C). If using charcoal, bank the lit coals on either side of the grill bed, leaving a strip in the center without heat, and place a drip pan in the center. If using gas, preheat the burners, then turn off 1 or more of the burners to create a cooler zone. Brush and oil the grill grate.\n3. To make the salsa, place the tomatillos and chile over the direct-heat area of the grill. (You'll probably need a grill screen for the chile or you'll lose it through the grate.) Cook, turning as needed, until well charred on all sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer the tomatillos and chile to a blender, add the lime juice and oil, and pulse until combined but still chunky. Transfer to a bowl, fold in the cilantro, and season with salt. You should have about 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml). (The salsa can be made up to 1 week in advance and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.)\n4. Place the thighs, meaty side down, over the indirect-heat area of the grill. Cook, turning once, until the thighs are nicely grill-marked on both sides and firm to the touch and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh away from bone registers 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C), 10\u201415 minutes on each side.\n5. Transfer the thighs to a platter and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve at once with the tomatillo salsa."

Remove the chicken from the saucepan and let cool completely. Tear the chicken into shreds.\n2 Mash the avocado, mayonnaise, and vinegar together in a medium bowl with an immersion blender or large fork until smooth. Stir in the cilantro, parsley, jalapeno, and garlic. Add the chicken, red pepper, red onion, and scallion and mix together. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and add more vinegar to give the filling a pleasant, but not sour, tang. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n3 To make the arepas, stir 3 cups lukewarm water and the salt together in a large bowl to dissolve the salt. Gradually add 3 cups cornmeal, mixing with your fingers to dissolve any lumps, adding enough to make a soft dough that holds its shape without cracking when molded. Set dough aside to rest for 3 minutes. Add the oil and work it in with your hands, adding cornmeal or water to return the dough to the proper consistency.\n4 Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Shape each into a 4-inch diameter disk, about 1 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet.\n5 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat.\n6 In batches, place the arepas in the skillet. Cook until the underside is a splotchy golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Return arepas to the baking sheet.\n7 When all of the arepas are browned, transfer them directly to the oven rack (without the baking sheet). Bake until the surfaces of the arepas have formed a taut skin-if you rap your fingers on one, it will feel and sound like a drum. Return arepas to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Split each arepa in half and fill with the chicken mixture. Serve warm."

In a large bowl mix together the sausage, basil, oregano, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste until all the seasonings are well distributed throughout.\nRoll out all the puff pastry into one large rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Put the wide side of the rectangle to your left. Form the sausage meat into a log about 1 inch thick and long enough to fit the width of the pastry. Lay this log along the whole edge. Roll the pastry around the sausage, brush with beaten eggs at the join, and cut so that the pastry has just enough room to slightly overlap. Repeat the process with the remaining sausage meat and pastry. Line up all the sausage rolls making sure the seam on each is at the bottom and not showing. Brush the tops with the eggs and cut the sausage rolls into either 1 1/2-or 3-inch logs.\nSpread about one inch apart on a baking sheet, and bake until golden brown and the meat is cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes. You can also freeze the rolls to be cooked later. Serve warm or cold."

If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to medium.\nIf using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the grill to high; then, when smoke appears, lower the heat to medium.\nPop the tab on the beer can. Using a \"church key\" style can opener, make 6 or 7 holes in the top of the can. Pour out the top inch of beer, then spoon the remaining dry rub through the holes into the beer. Holding the chicken upright, with the opening of the body cavity down, insert the beer can into the cavity.\nWhen ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss half the wood chips on the coals. Oil the grill grate. Stand the chicken up in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan. Spread out the legs to form a sort of tripod, to support the bird.\nCover the grill and cook the chicken until fall-off-the-bone tender, 2 hours.

(Have the board or platter right next to the bird to make the move shorter. Be careful not to spill hot beer on yourself.) Let stand for 5 minutes before carving the meat off the upright carcass.

Add chopped garlic and stir 20 seconds. Mix in agave nectar and crumbled chiles; stir 1 minute. Add all citrus juices. Bring mixture to boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until glaze thickens enough to coat spoon, about 20 minutes. Strain glaze into small microwave-safe bowl, pressing hard on chile solids to release all liquid. Discard solids in strainer. Mix in fish sauce. Season glaze to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Glaze can be prepared up to 3 days ahead. Cool, cover, and refrigerate. Rewarm glaze in microwave before continuing.\nMix 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro into glaze.\nPrepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Coat inside of large grilling basket with nonstick spray. Wipe fish dry inside and out. Score each side of fish 3 times, cutting to bone. Sprinkle fish inside and out with salt and cayenne.\nPlace fish in basket; place on grill rack. Close grill and cook 6 minutes. Turn basket and brush 2 tablespoons glaze over fish, opening basket if necessary and closing again. Cover grill. Cook fish until just opaque in center, about 7 minutes.\nTurn fish out onto platter. Brush 2 tablespoons glaze over. Top with cilantro."

For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.\n2. In the cavity of each fish, place 2 sprigs each of tarragon, dill, and parsley, and 2 stems of chives. Season with salt and pepper. Place 2 fish on each plank.\n3. Brush the cut sides of the lemons and onions with olive oil.\n4. When you see the first wisp of smoke, place the planks on the indirect side of the grill. Set the onion and lemon halves, cut side down, directly on the grate over the fire and close the lid.\n5. Check the lemons after 2 or 3 minutes. If they have nice grill marks, remove them from the grill. The onions will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes and may be turned after the first 10 to 12 minutes. When they are nicely charred, remove them from the grill, too. Close the lid and continue to cook the fish until it is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes total.\n6. Fillet the char and serve on a platter with the lemon and onion halves.\nOven Smoke-Planking: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Place the herb-stuffed planked fish in the middle of the oven. Oven smoke-plank for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork. Garnish with lemon wedges. (Omit the onions.)"

Cook the eggplant until well marked, 3 to 6 minutes, then turn the slices over. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove the eggplant from the grill.\nPour the vinegar into a shallow bowl. While still hot, dip each eggplant slice into the vinegar and set it aside on a plate. Continue grilling and dipping the eggplant until all the slices are cooked and seasoned.\nSpoon 2 tablespoons of the parsley mixture onto a platter and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon. Arrange half of the grilled eggplant on the parsley in a single layer. Smear each slice of eggplant with more parsley. Place a second layer of eggplant on top and spread the remaining parsley on it. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and set aside to marinate at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate for longer). Serve at room temperature.\nYou could make the parsley mixture in a food processor, but I don't. I find hand chopping gives me the somewhat drier texture I prefer.\nFor this recipe, I don't salt or oil the eggplant; I grill it dry. This way, it has a nice chewy texture. I marinate the eggplant as soon as it comes off the grill so the flavor of the marinade penetrates."

    "instructions": "1. If using the rub, combine the mild paprika, brown sugar, hot paprika, celery salt, garlic salt, dry mustard, pepper, onion powder, and salt in a bowl and toss with your fingers to mix. Wearing rubber or plastic gloves if desired, rub the spice mixture onto the pork shoulder on all sides, then cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 3 hours, preferably 8.\nIf not using the rub, generously season the pork all over with coarse (kosher or sea) salt and freshly ground black pepper; you can start cooking immediately.\n2. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and place a drip pan in the center.\nIf using a gas grill, place all of the wood chips in the smoker box and preheat the grill to high; when smoke appears, reduce the heat to medium.\nIf using a charcoal grill, preheat the grill to medium-low and adjust the vents to obtain a temperature of 300\u00b0F.\n3. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss 1 cup of the wood chips on the coals. Place the pork shoulder, fat side up, on the hot grate over the drip pan. Cover the grill and smoke cook the pork shoulder until fall-off-the-bone tender and the internal temperature on an instant-read meat thermometer reaches 195\u00b0F, 4 to 6 hours (the cooking time will depend on the size of the pork roast and the heat of the grill). If using charcoal, you'll need to add 10 to 12 fresh coals to each side every hour and toss more wood chips on the fresh coals; add about 1/2 cup per side every time you replenish the coals. With gas, all you need to do is be sure that you start with a full tank of gas. If the pork begins to brown too much, drape a piece of aluminum foil loosely over it or lower the heat.\n4. Transfer the pork roast to a cutting board, loosely tent it with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.\n5. Wearing heavy-duty rubber gloves if desired, pull off and discard any skin from the meat, then pull the pork into pieces, discarding any bones or fat. Using your fingertips or a fork, pull each piece of pork into shreds 1 to 2 inches long and 1/8 to 1/4 inch wide. This requires time and patience, but a human touch is needed to achieve the perfect texture. If patience isn't one of your virtues, you can finely chop the pork with a cleaver (many respected North Carolina barbecue joints serve chopped 'cue). Transfer the shredded pork to a nonreactive roasting pan. Stir in 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the vinegar sauce, enough to keep the pork moist, then cover the pan with aluminum foil and place it on the grill for up to 30 minutes to keep warm.\n6. To serve, mound the pulled pork on the hamburger buns and top with coleslaw. Let each person add more vinegar sauce to taste."

If you do not have a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, sugar, and salt in a small food processor and puree to a paste, then work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. Spoon the marinade over the chicken, forcing it into the slits and turning the bird to coat it well on both sides. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 hour to 4 hours; the longer it marinates, the richer the flavor will be.\n3. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the crushed clove of garlic and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small heatproof bowl. Add the annatto seeds to the saucepan with the oil and cook until fragrant and browned and the oil turns orange, about 2 minutes. If you are using paprika instead of annatto seeds, cook it for only 15 seconds. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh wire strainer into the bowl with the garlic. Set the glaze aside.\n4. Prepare the dipping sauce: Place 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, if using, in 2 small attractive bowls. Have the limes ready; you'll add the lime juice at the last minute. (See Note.)\n5. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to medium. Leave one section of the grill bare for a safety zone.\n6. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade and arrange it on the hot grate or in an oiled grill basket, if using, skin side down. Grill the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes per side. Move the chicken as needed to dodge any flare-ups. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170\u00b0F. Alternatively, you can make a cut in the chicken meat where the thigh connects to the body; there should be no traces of red at the bone. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, start brushing the chicken on both sides with the glaze.\n7. To serve, transfer the chicken, skin side up, to a platter. Let it rest for about 2 minutes, then cut it into pieces with a cleaver. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to each bowl with the salt, pepper, and sugar for the dipping sauce and stir it with a fork or chopsticks until the salt and sugar dissolves. To eat, dip the pieces of chicken in the salted lime juice.\nKhmer Chicken Grilled Using the Indirect Method: You can also grill the chicken using the indirect method, a process that, although not traditionally Khmer, has the advantage of eliminating all risk of flare-ups. Set up the grill for indirect grilling, place a drip pan in the center, and preheat the grill to medium. Place the marinated chicken skin side up in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until browned and cooked through, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Start brushing the chicken with the glaze during the last 15 minutes of cooking and baste it again every 5 minutes."

(You can also complete this step ahead of time, refrigerate the mushrooms, and then bring them to room temperature when you're ready to stuff the tomatoes.)\nMeanwhile, prepare the tomatoes so that you can use them to serve your salad in. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0 F. Using a sharp knife, slice the tops off the tomatoes either flat or in a zigzag pattern; you need them later so don't discard them. Using a melon baller or spoon, scoop out the insides. (You may want to save the insides for a sauce or another salad.) Set aside. Place the tomatoes into a 1-inch baking pan (you may have to adjust the bottoms\u2014cutting carefully and only slightly\u2014if they can't sit upright), with their tops. Bake until the skins start to wrinkle, about 15 minutes.\nWhen the tomatoes are finished, remove the tops and stuff with alternate layers of the mushroom mixture and the cheese. Place the tomatoes back into the oven (without the tops) just until the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes.\nTop each tomato with a bit of the mixed baby greens and a drizzle of the vinaigrette. Cover with the tomato tops, and serve."

Set aside.\nTwo: Cut the ham and cheese into thin slices 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long. Break the egg into a shallow bowl and beat until smooth. Spread the crumbs on a second shallow bowl. Spread the flour on a dinner plate.\nThree: Lay the chicken pieces on a flat work surface skinned side down. Lightly spread the inside of each breast with a little mustard (don't use too much or the mustard will overpower the other flavors). Stack 2 slices of cheese and a slice of ham (2 if they are very thin) in the center of each breast. Fold over the small side of the breast, then fold each end up, like an envelope, and finally fold over the large side. Make sure that the filling is completely encased. Roll the chicken first in the flour, shake off the excess, and dip each breast in the egg, allowing the excess to flow back into the bowl. Lay it in the crumbs. Roll it carefully so that it doesn't open up (crumbs should not get inside the folds or they won't stay closed when it cooks), patting the crumbs into all sides. When the piece is coated, lay it on a clean, dry plate and repeat until all the pieces are breaded. Set aside for at least half an hour to allow the breading to set. (You may make them several hours or even a day ahead up to this point. Cover and refrigerate, but take them out at least half an hour before cooking.)\nFour: Fill a deep Dutch oven, or a deep-fat fryer with enough peanut oil to come halfway up the sides, at least 2 inches deep. Over medium-high heat, bring the oil to 375\u00b0F (hot but not smoking). Add the chicken and fry until golden brown, maintaining a temperature of 365\u00b0F, about 4 to 5 minutes.\nFive: Drain well and serve at once."

Cook the chicken, partially covered, for 35 minutes, or until cooked through. To check for doneness, slit the chicken in half to make sure the interior is no longer pink.\nAllow the chicken to cool in the broth. When cool enough to handle, remove the chicken from the pan. Strain and reserve the broth. Shred the chicken by hand by pulling apart the fibers of the chicken with your fingers and set aside.\nCombine the tomatillos, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, garlic, and water in a blender and pur\u00e9e until well blended.\nHeat the oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat.\nWhen the oil is hot, add the onion and saut\u00e9 until the onion is limp and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatillo mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.\nAdd the shredded chicken to the sauce and stir to coat. Allow to cook for 3 more minutes. Check the seasoning and adjust if needed. Set aside.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil then remove from heat. Add the corn husks, making sure to submerge them under water, and cover the pot. Soak the corn husks in the pot for 20 minutes. They should be soft and flexible, and take on a deep beige color. Remove the corn husks from the water and wrap them in a damp paper towel until you are ready to use them.\nTo make the masa, combine the masa harina with 2 cups of the reserved chicken broth and mix well. The masa should have the consistency of a stiff dough. Set aside.\nPut the lard in a mixing bowl. Beat the lard with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add half of the masa and beat until well blended. Add the 3 tablespoons of the reserved chicken broth and the remaining masa and continue beating until a teaspoon of the dough dropped into a cup of cold water floats, about 10 minutes. If after 15 minutes of constant beating your dough does not float, move on (despite it not floating, the dough will be fine).\nSprinkle the baking powder and the salt over the dough and mix in well.\nPlace a corn husk lengthwise in front of you with the wide side closest to you. Spread 2 tablespoons of the dough all over the bottom half (wide side) of the corn husk, leaving about a 1-inch-wide border on the left and right sides.\nPlace 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling lengthwise down the center of the dough. Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and unite them. Allow the dough to surround the filling by pinching together the corn husk where the dough comes together. Roll both sides of the corn husks in the same direction over the tamal. Fold down the empty top section of the cornhusk and secure it by tying a thin strip of corn husk around the tamal (the top will be open).\nRepeat this process until all the corn husks or tamal dough are used up.\nCreate a tamal steamer by crumpling a large piece of aluminum foil into a large ball. Place the foil ball in the center of a large saucepan and arrange the tamales \"standing up\" around it. You can stand tamales in front of each other; just make sure that the open end of the tamal is facing upward.\nPour in 1/2 inch of water. Cover tightly with a lid and simmer for 40 minutes.\nServe warm accompanied by Mexican crema."

Shake the pan to distribute the sugar and water and caramelize over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally. The sugar will gradually liquefy and darken; when it becomes golden brown, remove from the heat.\n3. Carefully add the nam pla (it may spatter; hold the pan at arm's length), then return to the heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook, stirring, until softened.\n4. Add the chicken wings and coat with the sauce. Gently stir in the ginger and pepper and continue stirring until the chicken browns slightly, about 4 minutes. Cover and cook for 7 minutes, then transfer to the oven and cook for 45 minutes.\n5. Remove the chicken wings, which should now be a rich caramel color, garnish with cilantro and cracked black pepper, and serve."

    "instructions": "1. Liberally butter a shallow 2-quart (2-L) baking dish, with sides that are at least 2 1/2 inches (8 cm) high. Sprinkle a few spoonfuls of sugar inside,tilt the dish to coat the bottom and sides, then tip out any excess.\n2. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n3. Using a rubber spatula or an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, mash the very soft butter with the lemon zest and cornstarch until completely smooth. Beat in the egg yolks until smooth, then whisk in the fromage blanc.\n4. With an electric mixer or by hand, whisk the egg whites with the salt in a clean, dry bowl (not plastic) until frothy. Increase the speed and beat until the whites begin to mound and hold their shape. While whipping, gradually add 10 tablespoons of the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Once you've added all the sugar, beat until stiff.\n5. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the fromage blanc mixture, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until incorporated. It's okay to have some tiny bits of white; that's preferable to overfolding the batter.\n6. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish, gently smooth the top, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.\n7. Bake on a middle rack (or slightly higher, if possible) for 30 minutes, until the top is browned and the souffl\u00e9 is just set but still very jiggly in the center if you nudge it. Depending on your oven, this may take slightly less or more time. Rather than going by strict baking times, touch the center to tell when it's done. If you like your souffl\u00e9 creamy in the middle, the center should feel rather soft, like runny pudding.\nIf you like it more firm, you can bake it until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out pretty clean."

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are soft and the tomatillos turn pale green, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.\nCarefully transfer the boiled vegetables, along with the cooking water, to a blender. Puree for a few seconds to blend; be sure to hold down the lid with a kitchen towel for safety. Add the 1/2 bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt, and broth. Continue to puree until smooth. You should have about 1 quart of salsa verde.\nPlace a wide pot or pan over medium-high heat and coat with the corn oil. When the oil is hazy, pour in the salsa verde; it will bubble a bit. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to very low, and keep warm while you finish the chips.\nPour the vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot or countertop deep fryer to a depth of about 2 inches and heat to 375\u00b0F over medium-high heat. Stack the tortillas and fan them with your thumb to separate. Cut the tortillas into 8 wedges like a pie.\nWorking in batches, fry the tortilla chips, turning them with a skimmer or slotted spoon so they don't stick together, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chips to a paper towel-lined baking pan or brown paper bag to drain and cool. (Let the oil return to the proper temperature between batches.)\nTo finish the chilaquiles, uncover the salsa verde and raise the heat to medium. Just when it starts to bubble, stir in the beaten eggs. Cook and stir for about 5 seconds, until the egg feathers into the sauce, thickening and binding it. Immediately add the chips, tossing gently until they have absorbed enough sauce to become soft. Take care not to break the chips. Sprinkle the Jack cheese on top and let it melt.\nDivide the chilaquiles among 4 plates. Sprinkle with the queso fresco, chopped onion, and cilantro. Garnish with the crema fresca and serve immediately."

Rub all over with salt and sprinkle some inside the cavity.\nPut on a rack and roast upside down for 3 hours at 250\u00b0 F (200\u00b0 F convection). Drain the fat into a bowl, set the duck the right way up and increase the heat to 350\u00b0 F (325\u00b0 F convection) for 45 minutes longer, till nicely browned. Leave to stand for 15 minutes, loosely covered with foil.\nReduce the chicken stock with the tomato and herbs to a saucelike consistency, then strain into a clean pan. Simmer the olives in water for 2 minutes to temper the flavor, then strain and stir into the sauce.\nCut the duck into pieces and serve with the sauce."

    "instructions": "Prepare the matzo balls: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Cut off the fennel stalks and reserve for another use (excellent for fish broths and stews). If there are some attractive feathery fronds, set aside about 2 tablespoons of them to garnish the soup. Quarter the bulbs and trim away the stems, the bottom hard core, and any tough parts. Choose a shallow baking pan just large enough to fit the fennel in one layer and put in 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the fennel and toss until well coated. Roast the fennel until pale gold, about 20 minutes, then turn the fennel over and roast for 10 minutes longer. Stir in the broth, garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and 1/2 teaspoon of the thyme. Cover the pan with foil and cook for 35 to 45 minutes longer, or until the fennel is very soft. Remove the foil, stir, and roast for a few more minutes to evaporate most of the liquid. Transfer the fennel and garlic to a food processor and chop coarsely. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of thyme, salt (it will need about 1 teaspoon), pepper to taste, and the fennel seeds, if using. With the machine on, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil through the feed tube.\nScrape the mixture into a large bowl. You need 1 cup of puree, so nosh on any extra. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Add the matzo meal and stir well. If you can form a lump into a very soft walnut-size ball (the batter will become firmer when you chill it), don't add any more matzo meal. If necessary, add just enough matzo meal to enable you to do so. Refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 4 hours so the matzo meal can drink in the liquid and seasoning.\nWhen ready to cook, bring 4 quarts water and 1 tablespoon of salt to a rapid boil in a large, wide, lidded pot. Dipping your hands into cold water if needed, roll the batter into walnut-size balls. When all the balls are rolled and the water is boiling furiously, turn the heat down to a gentle boil. Carefully slide in the balls one at a time and cover the pot tightly.\nTurn the heat down to a simmer, and cook over low heat for 30 minutes, without removing the cover. (They will cook by direct heat as well as by steam, which makes them puff and swell, and lifting the lid will allow some of that steam to escape.) Take out a dumpling and cut it in half. It should be light, fluffy and completely cooked through. If it isn't, continue cooking a few more minutes. Remove the balls gently with a skimmer or large slotted spoon\u2014they are too fragile to pour into a colander.\nWhen the matzo balls are almost ready, start the soup: Bring the broth to a simmer in a large pot. Add the matzo balls, the mushrooms, and asparagus and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to shallow soup bowls and ladle the hot soup and the vegetables over them. Garnish with the reserved chopped fennel fronds."

      "grated lemon zest"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\nDrop the garlic cloves into a small saucepan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain immediately. Peel as soon as the garlic is cool enough to handle. Set aside on paper towels to dry.\nHeat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed roasting pan or casserole large enough to accommodate the meat in one layer. Use two burners, if necessary. Add the brisket and brown well on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a platter and set aside. (Or brown the meat under the broiler: place the brisket, fat side up, on a foil-lined broiler pan under a preheated broiler. Broil for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, until browned. Don't allow it to develop a hard, dark crust, which might make the meat tough or bitter. Move the meat around as necessary, so it sears evenly.)\nPour off all but about 1 tablespoon of fat remaining in the pan and add the garlic cloves. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic edges are tinged with gold. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add the stock, thyme, and rosemary sprigs, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Salt and pepper the brisket to taste on all sides, and add it to the pan, fat side up. Spoon the garlic cloves over the meat.\nPlace the brisket in the oven, cover (if you have no lid, use heavy-duty foil), and cook, basting every half-hour, until the meat is fork tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours or longer. (As the meat cooks, periodically check that the liquid is bubbling gently. If it is boiling rapidly, turn the oven down to 300\u00b0F.)\nThe brisket tastes best if it is allowed to rest, reabsorbing the juices lost during braising, and it's easiest to defat the gravy if you prepare the meat ahead and refrigerate it until the fat solidifies. That is the method I use, given here, but the gravy can be prepared by skimming the fat in the traditional way, if you prefer. If you go that route though, do let the meat rest in the pan sauce for at least an hour.\nCool the brisket in the pan sauce, cover well with foil, and refrigerate until the fat congeals. Scrape off all solid fat. Remove the brisket from the pan and slice thinly across the grain.\nPrepare the gravy: Bring the braising mixture to room temperature, then strain it, reserving the garlic and discarding the thyme and rosemary sprigs. Skim and discard as much fat as possible from the liquid. Puree about one half of the cooked garlic with 1 cup of the defatted braising liquid in a food processor or a blender. (If you want a smooth gravy, puree all of the cooked garlic cloves.) Transfer the pureed mixture, the remaining braising liquid, and the rest of the cooked garlic to a skillet. Add the chopped rosemary, minced garlic, and lemon zest. Boil down the gravy over high heat, uncovered, to the desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Rewarm the brisket in the gravy until heated through.\nArrange the sliced brisket on a serving platter. Spoon some of the hot gravy all over the meat and pass the rest in a separate sauce boat."

Turn fillet over, lower heat to moderately high, and continue cooking until just opaque, less than 1 minute. Transfer to paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain, wipe pan clean, and cook remaining fish in same manner.\nTransfer 2 endive halves to center of each plate. Run small, thin knife or offset spatula around inside edges of ramekins to loosen flans, then turn 1 out onto side of each plate. Spoon garlic nage over endive and top with turbot. Grate 1 teaspoon truffle over each fillet and serve immediately."

We like the 2006 Riesling ($14) from Koehler Winery in California's Santa Ynez Valley. Its citrus and green apple flavors are a nice foil for the smoky chiles here. For a more classic pairing, go for beer: Try a hoppy, malty IPA (India Pale Ale), like Northern California's Lagunitas IPA ($9 for a six-pack)."

If you have time, wrap the brisket in plastic and let it cure, in the refrigerator, for 4 to 8 hours (or even overnight), but don't worry if you don't have time for this\u2014it will be plenty flavorful, even if you cook it right away.\n3. Set up a charcoal grill for indirect grilling and preheat it to low. No drip pan is necessary for this recipe.\n4. When ready to cook, toss 1 1/2 cups of the wood chips on the coals (3/4 cup per side). Place the brisket, fat side up, in an aluminum foil pan (or make a pan with a double sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil). Place the pan in the center of the hot grate, away from the heat. Cover the grill.\n5. Smoke cook the brisket until tender enough to shred with your fingers; 6 hours will likely do it, but it may take as long as 8 (the cooking time will depend on the size of the brisket and heat of the grill). Baste the brisket from time to time with the fat and juices that accumulate in the pan. You'll need to add 10 to 12 fresh coals to each side every hour and toss more wood chips on the fresh coals; add about 3/4 cup chips per side every time you replenish the coals during the first 3 hours.\n6. Remove the brisket pan from the grill and let rest for 15 minutes. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and thinly slice it across the grain, using a sharp knife, electric knife, or cleaver. Transfer the sliced meat to a platter, pour the pan juices on top, and serve at once.\nThe best Texas-style barbecue sauce combines the sweetness of Kansas City\u2013style tomato sauces with the mouth-puckering tartness of a North Carolina vinegar sauce. I've come up with my own version\u2014mix together equal parts of the Basic Barbecue Sauce and the North Carolina Vinegar Sauce . Serve this with barbecued brisket. For a really good sauce, add some meat drippings or a little chopped brisket."

Re-cover the grill and continue cooking the ribs until tender and almost done, 1/4 to 1/2 hour longer for baby back ribs, 1/2 to 1 hour longer for spareribs. The ribs are done when the meat is very tender and has shrunk back from the ends of the bones. If using a charcoal grill, you'll need to add 10 to 12 fresh coals to each side after 1 hour. Fifteen minutes before the ribs are done, season them with the remaining rub, sprinkling it on.\n7. To serve, cut the racks in half or, for a plate-burying effect, just leave them whole."

Cover and keep warm.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F.\nLine bottom of wok and inside of lid with double layer of heavy-duty foil, leaving 3-inch overhang along edges. In small bowl, stir together tea leaves and cilantro. Sprinkle mixture in even layer on bottom of wok and set rack in wok (it should rest about 2 inches from bottom).\nHeat heavy, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Remove duck breasts from marinade and transfer, skin-side down, to skillet. Sear without moving until skin is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nUsing tongs, transfer breasts, skin side up, to rack in wok, arranging about 1 inch apart. Heat wok over high heat, uncovered, until steady wisps of smoke begin to appear, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate, then cover wok and, using oven mitts, fold foil overhang from wok and lid together, crimping to seal tightly (foil will be very hot). Smoke duck breasts 10 minutes.\nSlice each pear in half lengthwise and, using small spoon or melon baller, remove seeds.\nIn heavy, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, melt butter. Stir in sugar, then add pears and gently toss to coat. Cook, uncovered, turning over once, until pears are caramelized, about 5 to 6 minutes per side.

Transfer potatoes to rimmed baking sheet and place alongside duck in oven. Roast duck to desired doneness, 7 to 8 minutes for medium-rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into breasts will read 135\u00b0F). Transfer breasts to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. When potatoes are warm, remove from oven, cover and keep warm.\nIn heavy, 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add asparagus, carrots, and baby corn and saut\u00e9 until lightly browned and heated through, about 7 minutes. Keep warm.\nIf necessary, rewarm sauce over low heat. Stir in blueberries.\nDivide potato slices among 4 large plates. Sprinkle duck breasts with pepper. Holding sharp knife at 45\u00b0F angle, cut each duck breast into thin slices. Arrange slices on top of potatoes. Place 1 pear half on side of each plate and arrange vegetables on other side. Spoon blueberry jus over plates and serve immediately."

Transfer to a bowl, then cover and let stand 10 minutes.\nPeel chiles, then stem, seed, devein, and coarsely chop.\nWhisk together tortilla flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and 1 3/4 teaspoons salt. Stir in water and let stand 5 minutes. Add 1 cup lard and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until absorbed. Let dough stand until ready to use (dough will stiffen).\nCook onion with 1/2 teaspoon salt in remaining tablespoon lard in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add chiles and corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, then stir into masa dough.\nPut 1 husk on a work surface, pointed end away from you, and, spreading it flat, mound 1/4 cup filling in center, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides. Bring wide end of husk over filling to cover, then fold in sides. Fold pointed end of husk over to form a packet and arrange, folded side down, on surface. Form more tamales in same manner.\nArrange tamales in 2 steamer racks and/or pasta pot inserts, standing them up in 1 layer in rows so they resemble fallen dominoes. Set steamer racks (on top of each other) over boiling water in a pasta pot (use 2 pots if you can't layer your racks; water should not touch racks) and steam, covered tightly, until filling is firm, about 1 hour. (Replenish water as necessary.)\nTo check for doneness, open 1 tamale to see if filling is firm and separates easily from husk; if it doesn't, steam 5 to 10 minutes more.\nRemove steamer racks from heat and let tamales stand 10 to 20 minutes while preparing grill.\nIf using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When coals are lit, dump them out across bottom rack (do not bank coals). When charcoal turns grayish white (start checking after 15 minutes), grill will be at its hottest. The grill will be at the right heat when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack over coals for 1 to 2 seconds.\nIf using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, covered, 10 minutes.\nOil grill rack, then grill tamales, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until grill marks appear on corn husks, 4 to 6 minutes total."

Add salt, honey, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, sage, peppercorns, allspice, and celery leaves. Add enough cold water to cover turkey \u2014 about 3 quarts. Press out air, close bags, and place in large bowl or other container to protect against leaks. Refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven.\nRemove turkey parts from brine, pat dry with paper towels, and place, skin side up, on racks set in 2 medium roasting pans (be sure to leave space between parts for air circulation). Pour 1 cup water into each pan. Drizzle turkey parts with melted butter and scatter with sage leaves. Place 1 pan on each oven rack and roast until beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.\nLower heat to 400\u00b0F, switch positions of pans, and rotate each pan 180\u00b0. Continue roasting until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast, avoiding bone, registers 165\u00b0, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Transfer turkey parts to platter and tent with foil.\nPour pan juices into 4-cup glass measuring cup, let stand until fat rises to top, 2 to 3 minutes, then skim off and reserve fat.\nSet 1 roasting pan across 2 burners, add 2 cups chicken broth, and bring to simmer over moderately high heat, scraping up any browned bits. Add simmering broth to pan juices in measuring cup, then add additional chicken broth, if needed, to equal 4 cups liquid.\nIn medium saucepan over moderately low heat, melt butter, then whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, until smooth, approximately 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in broth mixture and any collected juices from platter holding turkey, then raise heat to moderately high and boil mixture, uncovered, until thickened, about 8 minutes.\nSeason gravy with salt and pepper to taste. Carve turkey pieces and garnish with sage; serve with gravy."

Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over a high setting. When hot add the steaks and char on one side. Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking for about 3 minutes for medium rare. Turn the steaks with tongs and turn up the heat to high. Be careful not to cut into the steaks while turning so that you don't lose any of the juices. Sear the second side of the steaks, then turn the heat to medium and cook for another 3 minutes to medium rare. Add 2 to 3 minutes per side for well-done steaks. Serve with a green salad, Aji Asado (roasted marinated peppers), and Papas al Horno (roasted potatoes).\nIf using an electric oven broiler, char one side of the steaks on a high broil on a preheated broiler pan with the rack as close as possible to the broiler element. When browned, turn steaks with tongs and brown the other side. Total cooking time with this method is about 5 minutes per side for medium rare.\nLess time is required for gas broilers and outdoor charcoal barbecues. If using the latter, char meat directly on a rack over very hot coals on the hottest part of the barbecue, then move the meat to a cooler area of the rack over the drip pan leaving the barbecue lid open about one inch. Return the meat to the hotter area to char the second side and then move it back over the drip pan."

Pour enough oil into large skillet to coat bottom; heat over high heat. Add 1 tenderloin. Saut\u00e9 until bacon is brown, turning often, about 10 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with second tenderloin. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of each registers 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 30 minutes. Transfer to platter. Let stand 15 minutes. Cut off strings. Cut tenderloins into 1/2-inch-thick slices."

    ],
    "instructions": "Combine the bean thread noodles, mushrooms, onion, carrots, and green onions in a mixing bowl. Set aside.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the fish sauce, garlic, salt, sugar, and black pepper. Add the chicken and pork and using a fork, break up the meat, so it is thoroughly mixed with the seasonings. Add the noodle mixture and mix well. Set aside.\nCombine the cornstarch and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over low heat and stir often to prevent sticking. If mixture seems too thick, add more water. This will be the \"glue\" to seal the edges of the wrapper.\nCut the wrappers in half diagonally. You will have two equal triangles. Starting with the longest side toward you, place about 2 tablespoons of filling on the bottom area of the triangle. Using your fingers, mold the filling into a cylinder 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. Fold the two pointed ends of the wrapper in and roll to enclose. Dab a little cornstarch mixture along the edges (do not use too much \"glue\") and seal the roll. Set aside while you finish making the remaining rolls. Do not stack them.\nTo fry, preheat a large wok or fry pan. When hot, pour enough oil in to completely cover the spring rolls. Heat to about 325 degrees. Carefully place the rolls into the oil. Do not crowd the pan or place the rolls on top of each other. Fry the spring rolls until filling is cooked, about 5 to 6 minutes on each side, turning often until they are nicely brown and crisp. If they brown too quickly, reduce the heat as the oil is too hot. Remove the cooked spring rolls from the pan and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with dipping sauce and table salad .\nTo enjoy a spring roll the Vietnamese way, put it on a lettuce leaf, top with cucumber and mint, and wrap it up. Then dip in Vietnamese dipping sauce."

      "3 cloves garlic finely chopped",

      "coriander seed",
      "black pepper",
      "1 flank steak or piece of sirloin or top or bottom round steak 1 1 2 to 1 3 see note below"
    ],
    "instructions": "1. Rinse the lemons. Cut each in half and squeeze out the juice with a citrus press. Place the lemon juice in a large nonreactive mixing bowl. Cut the rind of 1 lemon into 1/4-inch dice and add it to the juice. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, oil, onion, garlic, bay leaves, coriander seed, and pepper and whisk to mix. Set aside half of the lemon juice mixture to use as a sauce.\n2. If using flank steak, score it on both sides in a crosshatch pattern, making shallow cuts on the diagonal no deeper than 1/8 inch and about 1/4 inch apart. This will keep the flank steak from curling as it cooks; you don't have to score sirloin or top or bottom round.\n3. Spread half of the remaining lemon juice mixture in the bottom of a nonreactive baking dish just large enough to hold the meat. Place the meat on top and spread the other half of the lemon juice mixture over it. Let the steak marinate for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight. The beef can also be marinated in a resealable plastic bag.\n4. When ready to cook, drain the meat, scraping off most of the marinade with a rubber spatula. Cook the beef, following the instructions below for any of the grills, until cooked to taste. To test for doneness, use the poke method; when cooked to medium-rare the meat should be gently yielding.\n5. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let sit for 5 minutes. Cut the meat into broad thin slices, holding a sharp knife blade at a 45-degree angle to the top of the meat. Spoon the reserved sauce over the slices and serve at once.\nCONTACT GRILL: When cooking on a contact grill, you're best off using a thick cut of steak, like sirloin or round (flank steak will most likely turn out well-done). Preheat the grill; if your contact grill has a temperature control, preheat the grill to high. Place the drip pan under the front of the grill. When ready to cook, lightly oil the grill surface. Place the beef on the hot grill, then close the lid. A thick slab of sirloin or round steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 7 to 10 minutes; flank steak will be cooked to medium after 3 to 5 minutes.\nGRILL PAN: Place the grill pan on the stove and preheat it to medium-high over medium heat. When the grill pan is hot a drop of water will skitter in the pan. When ready to cook, lightly oil the ridges of the grill pan. Place the beef in the hot grill pan. Sirloin or round steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 5 to 8 minutes per side; flank steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 4 to 6 minutes per side.\nBUILT-IN GRILL: Preheat the grill to high, then, if it does not have a nonstick surface, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the beef on the hot grate. Sirloin or round steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 5 to 8 minutes per side; flank steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 4 to 6 minutes per side.\nFREESTANDING GRILL: Preheat the grill to high; there's no need to oil the grate. Place the beef on the hot grill. Sirloin or round steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 6 to 9 minutes per side; flank steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 5 to 7 minutes per side.\nFIREPLACE GRILL: Rake red hot embers under the gridiron and preheat it for 3 to 5 minutes; you want a hot, 2 to 3 Mississippi fire. When ready to cook, brush and oil the gridiron. Place the beef on the hot grate. Sirloin or round steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 5 to 8 minutes per side; flank steak will be cooked to medium-rare after 4 to 6 minutes per side.\n\u2022 Rodolfo Lagua uses a marinade like this one when preparing tri-tips. To do this, start with a tri-tip that's between 2 and 2 1/2 pounds. Make the marinade following the directions in Step 1, then let the meat marinate for 12 to 24 hours.\n\u2022 You can grill the tri-tip in the rotisserie following these steps: Step 1: When ready to cook, place the tri-tip in the rotisserie basket. Place the drip pan in the bottom of the rotisserie. Attach the basket to the rotisserie, then attach the spit to the rotisserie and turn on the motor. If your rotisserie has a temperature control, set it to 400\u00b0F. Step 2: Cook the tri-tip until it is darkly browned on the outside and cooked to taste, about 40 minutes for medium-rare. To test for doneness, insert an instant-read meat thermometer through the side of the tri-tip but not so that it touches the spit. The internal temperature should be about 145\u00b0F for medium-rare. If your rotisserie has a pause button, after the tri-tip has cooked for 30 minutes, stop the spit so that a flat side of the tri-tip faces the heating element and let the meat brown for 5 minutes. Then, advance the spit a half turn and brown the other side for 5 minutes.\nIf You Have a\u2026\nCONTACT GRILL: The smaller and thinner the tri-tip, the better the results you'll get on a contact grill (thick pieces of meat tend to burn on the outside before becoming fully cooked in the center). Preheat the grill; if your contact grill has a temperature control, preheat the grill to high. Place the drip pan under the front of the grill. When ready to cook, lightly oil the grill surface. Arrange the tri-tip on the hot grill, placing pieces of aluminum foil between the grill plates and the meat; this will slow the burning process. Close the lid. The tri-tip will be cooked to medium-rare after 8 to 10 minutes.\nBUILT-IN GRILL: Preheat the grill to medium-high, then, if it does not have a nonstick surface, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the tri-tip on the hot grate. It will be cooked to medium-rare after 8 to 10 minutes per side.\nFREESTANDING GRILL: If you like your tri-tip very rare, you can cook it on a freestanding grill. Preheat the grill to high; there's no need to oil the grate. Place the tri-tip on the hot grill, then place a heavy skillet on top of the meat to keep it flat. The tri-tip will be cooked to rare after 10 to 12 minutes per side (it takes forever to get to medium or well done).\nFIREPLACE GRILL: Tri-tip is great in the fireplace, especially over red oak or post oak. Rake red hot embers under the gridiron and preheat it for 3 to 5 minutes; you want a medium-high, 4 Mississippi fire. When ready to cook, brush and oil the gridiron. Place the tri-tip on the hot grate. It will be cooked to medium-rare after 8 to 10 minutes per side."
