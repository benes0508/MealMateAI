Toss the apples with the clementines.\nIn a dry pan, toast the sesame seeds to a rich golden brown, then tip half of them into a small bowl and the remainder into the clementines and sprouts. Return the pan to the heat, and add the oil and then the almonds. Leave them to cook, moving them around the pan every few minutes, until they are golden and fragrant. Salt lightly, then remove and place on kitchen paper.\nDrain and lightly dry the sprouts and their leaves, then toss them gently with the apples and clementines. Squeeze the clementine and lemon and stir their juice into the reserved sesame seeds. With a fork or a small whisk, beat in the olive oil, white wine vinegar and honey.

You want to make sure you break up and liquefy all of the gelled juice.\nMeanwhile, place the cream in a medium-sized bowl, and with an electric hand-mixer, beat the cream at medium to medium-high speed until the cream holds medium peaks, about 2 - 3 minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture until fully incorporated and transfer to 5 small serving vessels.

Clean and lightly oil grate.\nMix vinegar, brown sugar, honey, Worcestershire, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, and 1/2 cup mustard in a medium bowl; set aside.\nSeason chicken on all sides with 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. salt. Grill chicken skin side down over direct heat, turning halfway through or whenever there is a flare, until lightly charred, 5-8 minutes. Move chicken to cooler part of grill, cover with lid, and continue to grill, turning several times and keeping covered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 140\u00b0F, 15\u201320 minutes. The smaller pieces will go more quickly ,and you can transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet until all pieces are ready.\nUncover grill and return any pieces from baking sheet back to grill. Using a brush, generously baste chicken with reserved sauce. Continue to grill, turning every 1\u20132 minutes and basting the other side, until the internal temperature of thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F and sauce is shiny and lacquered, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board as pieces are done (again, the smaller pieces will go more quickly). Let rest 10 minutes before separating drumsticks from thighs and slicing chicken breast in half on a bias.\nWhile chicken rests, gently toss onions, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl, being careful not to break up onion rounds into rings. Grill over medium-low heat, turning once, until charred on both sides and tender, 10\u201315 minutes.\nWhisk 2 Tbsp. bean pickling liquid and remaining 2 Tbsp. mustard in a large bowl. Drain beans and add to bowl. Add tomatoes and grilled onions. Toss to combine; season with salt.\nArrange chicken on a large platter and serve with salad alongside.\nDo Ahead: Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill."

Refrigerate when dry.\nStriped Easter Eggs: Wrap a portion of the egg with a rubber band before dyeing. Once the egg is dry, remove the rubber band to reveal the white, undyed strip underneath.\nDecal Easter Eggs: Another way to block off portions of the egg: Affix stickers or tape in shapes such as daisies or dots before dyeing. Remove once the egg is dry.\nFree-Hand Easter Eggs: A third way to block off portions: Before dyeing, draw on the egg with a light-colored crayon or wax. If desired, once the egg is dry, the wax can be softened by holding the egg over a candle flame and then wiped off.\nTwo-Toned Easter Eggs: All three of the above methods can be used to create two-toned eggs: Dye the whole egg a light color, such as pink, and let it dry. Then wrap the egg with a rubber band, affix stickers, or draw a design in crayon. Dye the egg a second color, such as blue. Once dry, remove the rubber band, stickers, or crayon. The areas blocked off will remain the first color (in this case, pink), while the rest of the egg will turn a combination of the 2 colors (in this case, purple).\nOmbre Easter Eggs: Dip a portion of the egg in one color and another portion in another color. If the two sections overlap, that area will turn a combination of the two colors."

      "milk any percentage will do",
      "3 heavy cream",
      "sugar",
      "1 diamond crystal kosher salt half as much if iodized"
    ],
    "instructions": "Combine milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it\u2019s almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scale, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started.\nPour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to 1 month. To mimic the consistency of canned milk, bring to room temperature before using.\nEven slightly acidic ingredients will cause hot dairy to curdle, including raw cane sugar, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, honey, and agave. Take care when experimenting with ingredients not listed in the variations.\nChai Spice: Along with the sugar, add two 4-inch cinnamon sticks, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries, 10 whole black peppercorns, 5 whole cloves, and 6 white cardamom pods, gently cracked. Proceed as directed. For an easy chai latte, stir 1 tablespoon of the spiced milk into 6 ounces (3/4 cup) hot black tea, such as Assam.\nDulce de Leche: This rich and nutty variation owes its caramel flavor and color to baking soda, which raises the dairy\u2019s pH, allowing the lactose to brown at lower temperatures than normal. Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the sugar and proceed as directed; though the mixture will foam more vigorously, there is no risk of overflow. Made with goat\u2019s milk in the variation below, dulce de leche is known as cajeta. As the browning process will resume with continued exposure to heat, neither dulce de leche or cajeta can be used as an ingredient in baked goods.\nFresh Ginger: Peel and roughly chop a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger; add along with the sugar.\nGoat's-Milk: This variation is more easily digested by those with lactose intolerance, and because goat\u2019s milk won\u2019t curdle when it\u2019s boiled, there\u2019s no need for cream. Trust me, there\u2019s nothing \u201cgoaty\u201d about it\u2014just gentle creaminess anyone can enjoy. Replace milk and cream with 38 ounces (4 3/4 cups) goat\u2019s milk and proceed as directed. Note: This variation requires \u201cultra-high temperature\u201d pasteurized goat\u2019s milk, as raw or low-heat pasteurized versions may turn grainy with prolonged cooking.\nLavender: During the cooking process, lavender mellows into something soft and aromatic, without any hint of the soapiness that can so often be its downfall. Add 1 tablespoon dried lavender buds along with the sugar.\nRosemary: Wonderfully herbaceous, this variation is my absolute favorite way to make Pumpkin Pie. Add a 4-inch sprig of fresh rosemary along with the sugar.\nSoft-Serve: This eggless ice cream has an unbelievably pure and creamy flavor, with a silkiness that reminds me of Dairy Queen soft serve. Prepare the Quick Condensed Milk or any variation and pour into a large bowl. Add 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream, 2 ounces (1/4 cup) whole milk, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (half as much if iodized), and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and mix well. Chill until cold, about 2 hours, and churn according to manufacturer directions.\nVanilla Bean: I make this variation whenever I have an empty vanilla bean left over from another project, as the cooking process will extract considerable flavor from even the most withered pod (the sheer volume of seeds in a \u201cfresh\u201d pod can turn the milk gray). Add scraped vanilla pod to the milk and proceed as directed. To deepen the flavor, leave the vanilla pod in the jar of Quick Condensed Milk."

The amount of salt you use should come to about 1.5\u20132.5%, but no more than 3%, of the cabbage weight.\nIn a large bowl, mix and massage the salt through the cabbage thoroughly, making sure to distribute the salt evenly.\nLet it sit to sweat a bit\u2014maybe 10 minutes. This is simply to make the next step easier. This is a good time to get your vessel cleaned and to rest up for the next stage.\nWith your pounder, pound quite energetically for about 5\u201310 minutes, until the cabbage is dripping with its own salty water when you pick up a handful. This part is important as you need this liquid\u2014it\u2019s your brine.\nYou can also use the dough hook of a stand mixer to do the pounding part, which can speed things up somewhat. Don\u2019t let it run for too long though, only a few minutes. Using a mixer is easy and great for people who are doing this a lot and in large batches, but it takes quite a bit of the emotional release and fun out of it.\nNext, mix in the caraway seeds (if using).\nPut the mixture into the jar, packing it down tightly as you go using the pounder. Push down well, particularly at the end to coax out any more brine. You need the brine to cover the cabbage.\nDon\u2019t pack the cabbage all the way to the top; leave some headroom at the top of the jar to allow for a bit of growth and movement and, of course, the weight. You don\u2019t want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.\nCover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.\nDepending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you\u2019d like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better. It is ready when you think it is delicious. With the right system and temperature, you can leave it to ferment for months before refrigeration.\nIf you used a crock, you\u2019ll need to decant the kraut to smaller jars before you refrigerate, unless you have a walk-in cool room, or large cellar. (Lucky you.) It will keep in the fridge for 12 months or more. Use your senses."

    "instructions": "A great Caesar salad gets its swagger from a great dressing. Squeamish about raw egg yolks and anchovies? Sorry. Yolks are what give richness to the emulsion, while anchovies provide a briny blast (and that whole umami thing). Here's our go-to recipe: Chop together 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, 1 small garlic clove, and a pinch of kosher salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in 2 large egg yolks*, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil, then 1/2 cup vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Can be made 1 day ahead.\nMake your own. Tearing, not cutting, the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Toss 3 cups torn 1\" pieces country bread with 3 tablespoons olive oil on a baking sheet; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake at 375\u00b0F, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10-15 minutes.\nUse whole leaves from 3 romaine hearts to feed 6 people. They provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.\nCaesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.\nSkip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parm."

Let stand in a dark spot 1 month.\nStrain through a cheesecloth-lined colander or sieve into a large measuring cup; discard solids. Gather up corners of cheesecloth to extract as much liquid as possible (wear gloves if you wish to avoid turmeric stains on your hands). Rinse out jar and pour in liquid. Add 2 Tbsp. honey, then shake covered jar or whisk to combine. Add more honey to taste.\nYou can transfer mixture to a few smaller bottles, such as swing-top bottles, as it\u2019s easier to pour from this way. Tightly seal and chill.\nCold Preventative: Sip by the spoonful when you feel a cold coming. You can also dilute it in water.\nFire Cider Tonic: This makes a great mocktail. Add about 1 Tbsp. fire cider and a squeeze of fresh orange juice to a glass of seltzer. Garnish with rosemary sprig.\nSalad Dressing: Use in place of apple cider vinegar in your favorite vinaigrette. You likely won\u2019t need to add any additional sweetener.\nFire Cider Tea: Add about 1 Tbsp. fire cider to a mug of hot water, along with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a little honey to sweeten. Finish with a bit of freshly ground black pepper.\nFresh Herb Sauces: Use fire cider in place of the red wine vinegar in sauces like chimichurri.\nMarinade for fish, chicken, or tofu: Think of fire cider as the acid in bright, assertive marinades similar to those for jerk chicken."

Wrap in paper toweling and refrigerate 24 hours.\nThe following day: Rinse off seasonings, blot very dry, and wrap in pairs in boilable pouches, then use a FoodSaver or professional vacuum packing device to seal airtight. Cover one stovetop burner with a Simmer Mat or heat diffuser. Place the sealed pouches in a deep flameproof ceramic or cast-iron casserole and cover with hot water. Be sure the pouches are completely submerged; if necessary, weight them down. Place the casserole over the mat or heat diffuser set over medium-low heat. Cover the casserole and heat to 180\u00b0F (use an instant-read thermometer), then reduce heat to low and allow to simmer at a constant 180\u00b0F temperature for at least 8 hours for Moulard, 9 for Muscovy, or 5 to 6 hours for Pekin. (If you have an electric oven, alternatively, you can place the pouches in very hot water in a casserole and cook at 180\u00b0F overnight. (Because of the constant water temperature, the flesh won\u2019t cook beyond its stage of \u201cdoneness.\u201d)\nThe duck is ready when the flesh feels very tender, begins to separate from the bone, and the joint between leg and thigh cracks easily. When you remove the pouches from the casserole, immediately set the pouches in a bowl of ice water to chill until completely cold, about 30 minutes. The fat should congeal. Refrigerate until ready to use, within one week (see Cooks' Notes below).\nWhen ready to serve: Place the pouches under warm running water until you can easily break the chunks of the fat away from the meat. Open each pouch and separate the fat and jelly-like juices from the flesh. Set the fat aside for some other purpose; use juices for sauces or add to the beans. If using for cassoulet, bone the legs and break the meat into large chunks. Brown the skin to a crisp in a skillet; season the flesh side with pepper. Add the meat chunks and skin to the cassoulet"

Immediately remove the colander from the water, letting the water drain from the asparagus. Plunge the asparagus into the ice water so they cool down as quickly as possible and retain their crispness and bright green color. (The asparagus will cool in 1 to 2 minutes. After that, they will soften and begin to lose crispness and flavor.) Drain the asparagus and wrap it in a thick kitchen towel to dry. (Do not cook the asparagus in advance or it will lose its crispness.)\nBreak each egg into a ramekin or small cup. Set aside. In a large, shallow saucepan, bring 2 inches of water to a boil. Add the vinegar. One by one, bring the edge of a ramekin or cup level with the surface of the water and slide the egg in gently. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Poach the eggs until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny and are covered with a thin, translucent layer of white, about 3 minutes.\nWith the sieve or slotted spoon, carefully lift the eggs from the water and transfer them to several thicknesses of paper towels.\nPlace the salad greens and chives in a large salad bowl. Toss with just enough dressing to coat the greens lightly and evenly.\nPlace the asparagus on a large plate and add just enough dressing to lightly coat the spears. Roll the asparagus in the dressing.\nArrange the dressed greens at one side of each of 4 large dinner plates. (Rectangular plates are particularly beautiful here.) Carefully place a poached egg alongside. Arrange 4 asparagus spears next to the eggs. Carefully drape a slice of ham over each of the poached eggs. Season the greens lightly with fine sea salt and generously with pepper. Sprinkle with chives. Serve with the toast."

Once chocolate mixture has chilled, use a teaspoon, melon baller, or small scoop to drop truffle mixture by the heaping teaspoonful onto the prepared sheet. Form truffles into balls by rolling them quickly between the palms of your hands. This process is a little messy, so wash your hands in cold water halfway through rolling, if desired. Freeze truffles on prepared sheet for 20 minutes.\nCurry-Coconut In a medium bowl, mix together the curry powder and shredded coconut.\nOrange-Pistachio Finely chop the grated zest and pistachios by hand or using a food processor. Place in a medium bowl and roll the truffles in the mixture, pressing slightly to adhere the topping.\nStrawberry-Black Pepper Place strawberries in a resealable plastic bag. Use a rolling pin or other heavy object, crush the strawberries until a mix of small pieces and powder is formed. Place in a medium bowl and mix in the pepper.\nCaramel-Corn Finely chop the peanuts by hand or using a food processor. Finely chop the popcorn by hand or add to the chopped peanuts in the food processor and pulse a few times until popcorn is in small pieces. Mix the peanuts and popcorn in a medium bowl.\nOnce chilled, roll truffles in the topping of your choice (see above), pressing slightly to adhere the ingredients to the truffles.

In a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons canola oil until hot and shimmering. Place the bluefish fillets skin side down in oil and do not move once in skillet. Allow the skin to become crispy, this should take about 90 seconds. Without moving the fillets, place the pan in the preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through. Remove the skillet from the oven and drop the butter into the pan. As the butter begins to melt, baste the bluefish fillets. Remove from fillets from pan and set aside.\nPreheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Brush the corn with 1 tablespoon canola oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Grill corn, giving a quarter turn about every 20 seconds, allowing the kernels to become slightly charred. Once charred, remove from heat. When cool enough to handle, slice the kernels off the cob.\nIn a medium pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. Add the leek and garlic to the pan, cook until the leek begins to become transparent, about 45 seconds. Add the corn to the pan and heat through. Remove from heat and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.\nIn a medium pan over medium-low heat, warm the tomatoes in the olive oil just until they begin to release their juices. Remove from heat. Fold in the torn basil, season with sherry vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Just before serving fold in the sliced radishes.\nPlace 3/4 cup of charred corn in the center of a plate. Top with seared bluefish and a generous squeeze of lemon juice over each fillet. Finish with a swoop of tomato salad around the plate."

Mix the guajillo chile, vinegar, chile de arbol, salt, oregano, cumin, and cloves together in a nonreactive medium bowl. Add the beef and mix well. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 12 and up to 24 hours.\n3. Prepare the beans: Put the beans in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches (7.5 cm). Let them stand in a cool place (refrigerate if the kitchen is warm) for at least 12 and up to 16 hours.\n4. Drain the beans, put them in a large saucepan, and add enough fresh cold water to cover by 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heat them, stirring often, over medium-high heat just until the water boils. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the beans are barely tender, about 1 1/2 hours, depending on the freshness of the beans. During the last 30 minutes, add the salt to the saucepan. Drain the beans and set them aside.\n5. Make the chili: Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat. In 2 or 3 batches, add the marinated beef and cook, stirring often, until it is seared, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a bowl, leaving the fat in the pot.\n6. Pulse the onions and garlic together in a food processor until finely chopped but not pur\u00e9ed. (Or mince the onions and garlic by hand.) Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the Dutch oven and heat. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring often, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.\n7. Return the beef to the Dutch oven. Add the tomato pur\u00e9e, chile flakes, oregano, thyme, and cumin and stir well. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, for about 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender and the tomato juices thicken. Add hot water to the chili if it threatens to stick to the pot, and stir in the beans during the last hour. Season with salt and more Urfa chile flakes. If you like very spicy chili, add more ground chile de arbol. (The chili can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Spoon it into bowls and serve hot."

Roughly tear the basil leaves and put them in a small bowl. Pour the lemon juice mixture over the basil leaves and let steep for at least 15 minutes.\nPour the orange juice into a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over its surface. Let the gelatin soften for 5 minutes, then warm the pan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the gelatin is fully dissolved. Turn off the heat.\nStrain the basil out of the lemon juice and whisk the juice into the gelatin mixture. Pour the liquid into six small cups or a 1-quart (1-L) dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or until softly set. Garnish with whipped cream and basil leaves to serve.\nTo make little bites for a party, double the amount of gelatin in this recipe to 6 full teaspoons. Pour the mixture into an 8- or 9-inch (20- or 23-cm) square baking dish and let it set overnight in the refrigerator. Cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) squares, or use a small cookie cutter to cut out 1-inch (2.5-cm) circles. Skewer one or two pieces on a toothpick or party pick with a leaf of fresh basil folded and skewered at one end. Chill until ready to serve, and pass a bowl of whipped cream for dipping.\nReal Lime Jelly For real lime jelly (with the taste of fresh limes and no nasty green food coloring), substitute juice from 7 to 8 limes for the lemon juice. Substitute water for the orange juice. Meyer Lemon Jelly with Lavender Extra-sweet, less acidic Meyer lemons are also wonderful in this jelly, especially with the herbal-floral taste of lavender. Simply substitute Meyers for the regular lemons. You may need one or two extra lemons, as Meyer lemons are generally smaller. Instead of steeping basil in the juice, steep 1 tablespoon dried food-grade lavender buds. Strain after 10 minutes and proceed as directed above."

Form dough into a ball (it will be sticky); wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 4 equal portions and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Using your hands, roll 1 portion into a 1/2\"-diameter rope; cut crosswise into 1/2\"-thick pieces. Lightly dust gnocchi with flour and transfer to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining portions of dough. Cover gnocchi with a kitchen towel and chill until ready to cook. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 months ahead. Freeze on sheets, then store, frozen, in an airtight container.\nBring broth to a boil in a large saucepan. Add chicken; reduce heat to low, cover, and gently simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 20-30 minutes. Remove chicken; let cool slightly and shred into bite-size pieces. Bring broth to a boil and cook until reduced to 8 cups, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, melt butter in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and cook, whisking constantly, until roux is pale beige in color, about 15 minutes (do not brown).\nScrape roux into simmering broth; whisk until thickened and broth coats the back of a spoon. Reduce heat to low and add vegetables. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill, uncovered, until cold; cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before serving.\nCook gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until gnocchi float to the surface, about 2 minutes (slightly longer if frozen). Using a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to bowls, dividing equally. Ladle chicken and vegetables with gravy over. Season with pepper and top with Parmesan."

Combine the mixture with the pineapple juice in a blender or food processor and pur\u00e9e.\nSet a strainer over a small bowl and scrape the pur\u00e9e into the strainer, so that the liquid drains into the bowl below. Stir the pur\u00e9e gently as it strains to get as much liquid as possible without forcing any solids into the strained liquid. Discard the solids, reserving the liquid. You should have about 2 cups.\nThe pur\u00e9e can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, but is best if used immediately."

Stir in soy sauce and set aside to cool.\nCover the dried wakame with warm water in a medium bowl and soak for 5 minutes. Drain, squeeze dry, and set aside in a medium serving bowl.\nScoop out the seeds from each cucumber half with a small spoon and slice each cucumber half thinly. Sprinkle the salt over the sliced cucumbers and gently knead with your hands until the cucumber slices release their water, about 3 minutes. Transfer the to a clean kitchen towel, wrap the towel around the cucumbers, and squeeze out as much water as possible. Add to the bowl with the wakame.\nAdd the radishes, cilantro, and scallions to the wakame and cucumbers. Add half the rice vinegar mixture and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds. Toss to combine, and refrigerate until serving.\nLight a grill for direct high heat, about 500\u00b0F.\nCoat the chicken breast halves with the sesame oil and the remaining 6 tablespoons sesame seeds. Place one of the breast halves on a large sheet of plastic wrap, season it with salt and pepper, top with another sheet of plastic wrap, and pound until uniformly 1/16 inch thick and the approximate diameter of a dinner plate. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining breast halves, using fresh sheets of plastic for each one.\nBrush the grill grate and coat liberally with oil. Remove the plastic wrap from one side of 2 of the flattened breasts and place them on the grill so that they are spread out flat. The easiest way to do this is to support it from the plastic-wrapped side with your open hand and flip it onto the grill. Immediately lift off the sheets of plastic wrap. Grill until the chicken looks opaque at the edge, about 30 seconds. Flip with a spatula and grill 15 seconds on the other side. Remove to a platter, cover to keep warm, and repeat with the other 2 chicken breast halves.\nServe each paillard spread out flat on a dinner plate; it should nearly cover the entire serving surface of the plate. Drizzle the remaining rice vinegar mixture over the paillards, and place a large mound of seaweed salad in the center of each one."

Let it come to room temperature before you serve it.\nIt takes a minute or so for the blades of the blender jar to catch raw chopped tomatillos. Once they do, all the ingredients will be pulled toward them. Be patient, and do not add any water.

    "instructions": "Have the cake balls chilled and in the refrigerator.\nMelt the purple candy coating in a microwave-safe plastic bowl, following the instructions on the package. The coating should be about 3 inches deep for easier dipping. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)\nWhen you are ready to dip, remove a few cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.\nOne at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into a cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.\nLet dry in a Styrofoam block.\nPour the remaining purple coating into a large squeeze bottle, and pipe random, drizzled lines all around the monster head. Let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.\nOn some of the pops, pipe two small white circles with a candy writer for the eyes, and insert 2 chocolate jimmies before the coating sets.\nOn the remaining pops, pipe a single large, white circle. Let dry completely and draw a large blue circle inside the white circle, using a blue edible-ink pen. With a black edible-ink pen, outline the circle and draw a pupil to finish the eye.\nLet dry completely.\nYou can also use melted white candy coating for the eyes."

    ],
    "instructions": "To make the dressing, in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Cover tightly and shake vigorously to blend. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside.\nPlace the onions in a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Let stand for 30 minutes. This crisps the onion and takes away the raw onion taste. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels.\nIn a small bowl, toss the cranberries with 2 tablespoons of the dressing to soften them. Set aside for at least 20 minutes or until ready to serve the salad.\nTo assemble the salad, place the spinach, onions, and pears in a large bowl. Give the remaining dressing a last-minute shake and pour over the salad. Toss to coat evenly. Arrange the salad in a large serving bowl or divide it evenly among 8 salad plates. Scatter the cranberries and hazelnuts over the top(s). Serve immediately.\nTry to buy shelled hazelnuts (also called filberts) with the brown, papery skins removed as well. To toast, spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and place in a preheated 375\u00b0F oven. Toast for about 12 minutes until lightly browned. If the nuts still have the skins on, transfer them while they're hot to a clean kitchen towel. (Use a clean towel that is old or you don't mind washing with bleach, because the skins tend to discolor the fabric.) Rub the nuts to remove most of the skins (they never come completely off).\nYou can substitute unsalted cashews for the hazelnuts. Toast cashews, as directed above for hazelnuts, for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned."

Insert the skewer into the block of Styrofoam (see tip, below) and allow the paint to dry completely\u2014this usually takes about 5 minutes.\n2. Spatter the egg: In separate containers, dilute the brown and white paints with water. If you wish, cover your worktable with newspaper. Arrange the egg on the skewer in the Styrofoam. Dip the paintbrush in the brown paint, hold it in one hand above the egg and run your thumb along the bristles or tap the handle to create a spray of paint. Revolve the egg to splatter the entire surface. Let the paint dry completely, then repeat the process with the white paint. Let the paint dry completely.\n3.

Do the same with the salmon slices.\n3. Mix all the ingredients in a plastic bowl or plastic bag. Let the mixture soak for at least an hour in the fridge.\nServe the ceviche in shot glasses with a teaspoon. Ceviche tastes best cool, so serve the shot glasses on a deep tray filled with ice.\nThis dish keeps well in the refrigerator and can be prepared up to twenty-four hours beforehand; the citrus juice ensures the avocado doesn't turn brown and dull.\nMake a more traditional ceviche by using raw fish, shrimp, or scallops. Use lime juice instead of grapefruit, and add chopped tomatoes and cilantro. Use white fish, such as cod or snapper. Always freeze the fish for at least 3 days before you use it to kill any possible parasites."
