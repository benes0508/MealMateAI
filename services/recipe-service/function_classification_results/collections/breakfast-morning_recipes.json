Add the spinach and cook for 30 seconds, until it turns a vivid green, then, using a slotted spoon, transfer it to a bowl of ice water. Chill thoroughly and drain. Wrap the spinach in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel to wring out excess moisture, then roughly chop it and set it aside.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and \u00bc teaspoon of the salt and set aside. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-low heat until a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, just until the eggs form fluffy curds but have not fully set; they should still be slightly runny. Remove from the heat and let cool in a medium bowl.\nUse your hands to gently fold the eggs, sesame oil, oyster sauce, remaining 1\u00bc teaspoons of salt, and pepper together until fully combined. Gently fold in the spinach and mix until fully incorporated.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.\nFold the dumpling into the round yuan bao shape: Cradle the wrapper in your hands and fold the edge closest to you over the filling. Lightly squeeze the dumpling to push out any air bubbles. Clasp one end of the dumpling between your thumb and index finger to pinch it shut; repeat on the other side of the dumpling. Cradle the dumpling in your palms, clasping the sealed edge between your thumbs and index fingers, and squeeze it shut while pushing inward, making sure to squeeze out any air bubbles. The dumpling's belly should form a teardrop shape between your thumbs, which will create the yuan bao shape. Inspect the dumpling for any fissures that could rupture during cooking and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.\nWorking in batches, add the dumplings to the pot, 6 at a time. Boil for 2 minutes on high, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 1 minute, then reduce the heat again to medium and cook for 2 more minutes. The dumplings are ready a minute or so after they rise to the surface; their skins will turn puffy. Using a slotted spoon, gently transfer the dumplings to a plate and serve immediately. Bring the water back to a boil over high heat and repeat with the remaining dumplings."

Taste by dipping a tortilla chip into mixture; season with salt if needed.\nTransfer bean mixture to a large bowl (trying to add the chips to the skillet will make a mess, trust us). Gently stir in 8 cups chips with a rubber spatula until thoroughly coated without breaking chips. Return to hot skillet. Stick a handful of fresh chips vertically into mixture here and there\u2014they will get extra crunchy as the chilaquiles bake. Sprinkle Monterey Jack and Cotija over. Make 8 evenly spaced indentations in filling and carefully crack an egg into each. Bake until egg whites are opaque and cheese is bubbly, 10\u201315 minutes.\nTop chilaquiles with cilantro.

Add shallot mixture and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Mix in chile pur\u00e9e and cook, stirring often, until it starts to stick to bottom of skillet, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add sugar, tamarind concentrate, and \u00bc cup water and cook, stirring often, until sambal is much darker in color and thickened, 25\u201335 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Sambal ikan bilis can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.\nPlace rice in a medium saucepan and pour in cold water to cover; swirl with your hands to rinse away some of the starch. Drain and repeat process 2 more times. Water should be just slightly cloudy at this point. Place rinsed rice back into saucepan and cover with 2\u00bd cups cold water; stir in salt. Gather pandan leaves (if using) together and tie into a knot; add to pan. Bring rice to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover pan and reduce heat to low; cook 18 minutes. Remove lid and stir in coconut milk. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Carefully lower eggs into water. Cook 10 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Peel eggs and cut in half lengthwise.\nCombine sambal ikan bilis, reserved fried peanuts, and reserved fried anchovies in a medium bowl and toss to evenly coat. Scoop a generous \u00bd cup sambal mixture into a 12-oz. bowl. Top with 1\u00bd cups rice and pack into bowl with a rubber spatula to compress. The bowl should be filled to the rim. Place a slightly larger bowl upside down over bowl of rice. Invert so larger bowl is now on the bottom; lift off smaller bowl. You should have a dome of rice and anchovy mixture nestled in the center of the larger bowl. Arrange 8 cucumber slices around rice dome, overlapping slightly to make a semicircle. Add 2 egg halves to side of rice with no cucumber slices; season yolks lightly with soy sauce. Repeat with remaining rice, sambal mixture, cucumbers, and eggs to make 3 more bowls."

Once the bacon is cool, roughly chop it, then set it aside.\nTo make the sweet potato pur\u00e9e, I find it easiest to cut the ends off the sweet potatoes, then peel the skin off. Place the roasted flesh into a food processor, then add the coconut milk, vanilla, salt, and, if desired, collagen powder. Pur\u00e9e for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture is smooth. If it\u2019s too thick, add a splash more of the coconut milk and process again. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, combine everything in a large bowl and stir it very well with a wooden spoon.\nDivide the sweet potato pur\u00e9e between serving bowls. Top it with the chopped bacon, blueberries, sliced banana, and chopped almonds, and serve.\nThe bowls can be assembled ahead of time, but it\u2019s best to leave the fruit off until they\u2019re ready to eat. They can be eaten cold or gently reheated."

When the pan is hot, place 4 or 5 strips into the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side and 2 to 3 minutes after flipped. You may need to lower the heat so the pan doesn\u2019t get too hot and burn the bacon. Once or twice while frying a batch, add a little bit of the excess marinade to help caramelize the bacon. Also add more oil to the pan before frying each batch.\nRemove the fried strips from the pan and set on a plate. Placing the strips on paper towels isn't advised, as they will stick.\nThe bacon lasts up to 2 weeks stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. Warm up leftover strips in the oven or in a pan on the stove before serving with recipes."

(Don\u2019t worry about the large amount of salt here, the rice has a very short time to absorb the water and the final result won\u2019t be too salty.) Add the rice and cook for 4\u20135 minutes over a medium heat. Taste to test; the rice should be soft on the outside but still hard and firm in the middle. Drain, then rinse with tepid water to stop it cooking any further and set aside.\nMake a saffron liquid by using a pestle and mortar to grind the saffron strands with a pinch of sugar and then add the boiled water. Leave to steep.\nDrizzle the eggplant slices with some sunflower oil and season generously with salt. Grill for 10\u201315 minutes, turning occasionally, until the eggplants are cooked through.\nMeanwhile, make the rest of your filling. Heat 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil with 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan and fry the onion for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and fry for a further 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan along with the turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.\nLightly toast the cumin seeds in a small pan for a minute and then crush them with a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder, and add them too. Cook until the mushrooms are soft and then take off the heat.\nPre-heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the yogurt, saffron liquid, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Fold the rice in until it is evenly coated with the yogurt and saffron.\nRub 1 tablespoon butter over the base and sides of a 10-cup ovenproof glass dish. Spoon half of the rice into the dish and press it down evenly. Add a layer of eggplants and mushrooms and finish with a final layer of rice.\nDot with the remaining butter, cover the dish tightly with foil, and bake for 1 1/2\u20132 hours or until the base of the tahcheen is crisp and golden brown.\nWhen the tahcheen is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly while you make your topping. Melt the butter in a small frying pan and fry the barberries, pistachios, and sugar for 2 minutes until the sugar has melted and the dried fruit has plumped up.\nTo serve, run a butter knife around the sides of the tahcheen to separate it from the dish. Place a large board over the top and quickly invert the whole thing. Garnish with a sprinkling of the barberry and pistachio topping."

    "instructions": "In a medium mixing bowl, stir the eggs, using a wire whisk. Whisk in the sweetened condensed milk, followed by the whole milk, 3/4 cup (175 ml) of the brewed espresso, the extracts and the espresso salt. Whisk until all of the ingredients are well-blended, without creating bubbles, about 1 minute. Set aside.\nTo a round 1-quart (946-ml) aluminum flan mold or pan, add the sugar and the remaining tablespoon (15 ml) of brewed espresso and place on the burner. Turn the heat to high and begin caramelizing the sugar, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium-high as soon as it starts to melt, using a wooden spoon or medium silicone spatula, 2 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is completely melted and a beautiful golden Cognac color.\nTurn off and remove the mold immediately from the heat. Working fast, coat the entire mold with the melted sugar, rotating it in a controlled circular motion. If you are not experienced in handling extremely hot caramel, leave the mold on your counter and quickly coat with a pastry brush or a small silicone spatula. It is about 330\u00b0F (165\u00b0C) at this point. Set aside and let sit until the caramel sets, about 1 minute. Pour the custard mixture into the flan mold or pan, using a medium-mesh hand strainer to collect the egg embryo. This last step here is not entirely necessary.\nAdd enough water to the cooker to cover the mold halfway. Close the mold or cover your pan with aluminum foil and gently place in the middle of the cooker. Close the lid.\nStovetop Pressure Cooker: Set to high pressure (15 PSI) and set the timer for 16 minutes. Cook over high heat until the pressure point is reached, about 11 minutes, then turn off the heat but do not remove the cooker from the stove. The residual heat will finish cooking it. Allow the pressure to release on its own for the remaining 5 to 6 minutes.\nElectric Pressure Cooker: Set to high pressure (10\u201312 PSI) and 16 minutes. When done, cancel cooking. Allow the pressure to release on its own (natural-release).\nWhen all of the pressure is out, open the cooker and gently remove the mold, using silicone gloves. Do not unmold. Chill the flan for at least 5 hours, giving it enough time to set.\nRemove the flan from the fridge 30 minutes prior to serving. To unmold, open the flan mold and loosen the sides, using a butter knife. Place a large plate on top of the mold and gently but quickly flip upside down. Allow all of the liquid caramel to drizzle all over the flan. Garnish with almonds and ground espresso."

Stir or whisk until the cream is melted down and incorporated into the mix. Remove 1/4 cup (22 g) of the mixture from the pot and whisk in the tapioca starch. Reincorporate this slurry into the heated yogurt mixture. Stir once more and then remove the saucepan from heat.\nOnce the yogurt mixture has cooled to around 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), stir in the probiotic powder. Doing so prematurely may result in killing the bacteria, destroying its ability to culture properly, so be sure to let the yogurt cool.\nNow pour the water into the stainless bowl of your Instant Pot. Fill your glass bowls with the yogurt mix and place them inside the Instant Pot bowl. If your bowls do not all fit at once, you may stack them on top of each other as long as they do not spill over. Secure the lid and select the Yogurt feature. Cook for 6 hours and then remove the lid, take out the yogurt bowls, cover them and transfer them to the refrigerator to firm up further. Top with fresh fruit, grain-free granola or any other desired topping."

(Since water boils at different temperatures in different locations, it is important to follow this step.) Set some candy molds into a jelly-roll pan. Set aside. (If using metal or wood molds, lightly grease them.)\nEmpty the large pot and place the syrup in it. Add a few drops of oil. (Boiling maple syrup will foam up; the oil keeps the foam down. Buttering the rim of the pot will also help.)\nBoil carefully over high heat, without stirring, until the temperature of the boiling syrup is 28\u00b0F/17\u00b0C above the boiling point of your water (212\u00b0F/100\u00b0C at sea level).\nRemove from the heat and let cool for 3 to 5 minutes. Do not stir or disturb the candy at this point; if the thermometer is attached to the pan, leave it there during the cooling period.\nStir evenly until the liquid loses its gloss, starts to become opaque, and begins to thicken. (This is the tricky part; if you stir too long the thickened syrup will \u201cset up,\u201d or harden, in the pan. If this happens, add a cup of water, and reheat slowly to dissolve the sugar, then start over. But if you don\u2019t stir long enough, the sugar may not \u201cset up\u201d in the molds at all.)\nCarefully pour the candy into the molds. It\u2019s helpful to have an assistant spread the syrup in the molds while you continue to pour the mixture into the other molds.\nAllow the candies to cool, remove from the molds, place on a rack to dry for a few hours, and enjoy."

Let sit, uncovered, at least 12 hours before cutting. (Marshmallow will be firm but springy when pressed.)\nDust a cutting board with powdered sugar. Gently run a paring knife around the edge of the pan to release marshmallow and invert onto cutting board. Cut marshmallow into 3/4\"-wide strips and roll in powdered sugar. Coil into glass jars for gifting, or cut into 2\" pieces and roll in any remaining powdered sugar."

With the turkey or chicken skin side down and using a large sturdy knife, place the blade of the knife in the center of the breast bone, lengthwise. Using a meat mallet, firmly whack the knife to partially split the bone. Press the turkey or chicken to flatten slightly. Turn the turkey skin side up and press until flattened. Starting from the neck end, work your hands between the skin and flesh, being careful not to tear the skin. Work your hands as far down the legs as possible\nIn a small bowl, combine the pepper flakes with all but 1 teaspoon of the garlic paste, the salt, pepper, coriander and 1/2 cup of the oil. Rub half of the mixture under the skin.\nSet the turkey on a work surface skin side up and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Using 2 very long metal skewers, pierce the turkey crosswise diagonally, from drumstick through the opposite breast and through the wing forming a big X. Using the third skewer, pierce the turkey sideways through each breast. Rub the remaining paste all over the turkey or chicken and set it in a baking dish. Add the lemon halves, cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.\nIn another small bowl, combine the yogurt with the chives, oregano and remaining 1 teaspoon garlic paste. Season with salt and pepper and whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.\nLight a grill and oil the grates. Grill over medium flame for about 1 3/4 to 2 hours, turning occasionally, until lightly charred in spots and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thigh nearest the joint registers 170\u00b0.\nLet the turkey or chicken rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Serve with the yogurt sauce and Tabbouleh."

Toss with 2 wooden spoons until the kale wilts but is still bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir in the basil. Remove from the heat.\nFill a wide saucepan with enough water to measure 2 inches deep. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Break each egg into a separate tea cup. Turn off the heat under the saucepan. Immediately slide each egg from its cup into a different part of the water (the whites will spread out). Let the eggs stand until the whites are set and the yolks are still very soft to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, using tongs, toast each tortilla directly over high heat until beginning to blacken in spots, about 15 seconds per side. Put the warm tortillas on plates. Spoon 1 tablespoon of hummus on each tortilla and spread to cover, leaving a 1-inch border. Divide the kale mixture over the hummus.\nUsing a slotted spoon, lift each egg from the water, wiping excess liquid from the bottom of the spoon with paper towels. Put the eggs on top of the kale. Slit the yolks and press on the eggs a bit so the yolks begin to run (this will make them easier to eat). Fold up the bottom of each tortilla and then fold in the sides, leaving the wraps open at the top. Serve."

When the butter is melted and hot, add the potatoes and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Cook the potatoes, stirring every now and then, until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the green onions, mushrooms, garlic, thyme, and another sprinkle of salt and pepper and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have given off their liquid and are dry, about 4 minutes. Add the peas and cook until all of the veggies are tender and the peas are warmed through, another minute or two. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Spread the filling evenly over the bottom of the pan and sprinkle the cheese over the top.\n4. Pour the eggs evenly over the vegetables in the pan and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and cook for 2 minutes, then remove the lid and transfer the pan to the broiler. Broil the frittata until the top is lightly browned and the eggs have firmed up in the center, about 4 minutes. To test, press the center of the frittata lightly with your finger. If it feels firm, it's done.\n5. Remove the frittata from the oven and let it rest for 3 minutes on a wire rack on the countertop to continue to firm up before cutting it into wedges. It will be puffy when it comes out of the oven but will deflate and become firmer as it cools. Serve the frittata hot or at room temperature."

Tuck in the sides with a rubber spatula. Using a spatula or even your hands (careful!), quickly flip the cr\u00eape over and finish cooking. The first cr\u00eape is usually a test one, so don't worry if it sticks. Transfer it to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter. Stack all the cr\u00eapes. They should not stick together.\n4. At this point, you can fill them with anything or freeze them, stacked and tightly wrapped, for up to 1 month.\n1. In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the cloves of garlic and gently let the garlic infuse the oil for 1 to 2 minutes; then remove it. Do not burn the garlic.\n2. Add the mushrooms and thyme. Cook for another couple of minutes, until soft and slightly caramelized. Season with the salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n3. Add about 2 tablespoons of filling and a sprinkle of parsley to each cr\u00eape and roll them up. Serve immediately."

Set aside 1/4 teaspoon of the spice blend; reserve the remaining spice blend.\nLay out your halibut on a baking sheet/tray and season with salt and pepper. Brush or drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and rub the remaining spice mixture over the fish on both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nPrepare the carrots: While the fish rests, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, fill another bowl with ice and water to create an ice bath. When the water boils, add the carrots and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer them to the ice bath with a slotted spoon. Pull them out after about 2 minutes and set aside.\nMake the yogurt sauce: Toast the mustard seeds in a pan the same way you did with the coriander and fennel seeds. Crush or grind and stir together with yogurt, olive oil, and grated ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl.\nWhen the table is set, heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the halibut fillets to the pan and let cook untouched until they begin to release easily from the pan, about 4 minutes. Gently flip and cook the other side until the fish is just cooked through but still slightly translucent in the center. Remove the fish to the platter.\nHeat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in another large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the carrots and toss to coat. Season with salt. Add the shallot and cook until just beginning to soften but still purple, about 2 minutes. Pull from the heat and transfer the carrots to a plate or platter. Add the 1/4 teaspoon reserved spice blend to the residual oil in the pan. Spoon the flavored oil over the carrots and finish with parsley.\nServe fish and carrots on 2 pretty plates with carrots.

    "instructions": "Start by cleaning and sterilizing all your equipment and tools as well as your work surface. Most utensils and storage containers can be sanitized in the dishwasher (some machines have a sanitize setting). Alternatively, sterilize everything in boiling water.\nPrepare an ice bath, filling a large bowl or sink with ice.\nAttach a candy thermometer to a heavy, large pot and add the milk. Place the pot over moderate heat and heat the milk until it reaches at least 180\u00b0F or boils, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming and making sure the milk doesn't scald or boil over. Alternatively, place the milk in a large microwave-safe bowl or a large glass measuring cup with a spout (for easy pouring) and microwave it in 2- to 3-minute intervals, until it reaches 180\u00b0 or boils.\nRemove the milk from the heat and allow it to cool to 110\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F. To speed the cooling process, place the pot in the prepared ice bath and stir the milk occasionally. (If the milk temperature drops too low, return it to the heat.)\nIf using yogurt as a starter culture: In a small bowl, combine about 1 cup warm milk with the yogurt and stir to combine. Add the yogurt-milk mixture to the remaining warm milk and stir until completely incorporated. Do not stir vigorously.\nIf using a powdered yogurt culture: Follow the manufacturer's instructions and add the specified amount of powdered culture to the warm milk; whisk until completely incorporated. Do not stir vigorously.\nPour or ladle the mixture into the yogurt maker containers or another incubator (if using a thermos, first warm the inside with hot tap water) and incubate between 110\u00b0F and 115\u00b0F for 5 to 10 hours, depending on the desired flavor and consistency\u2014longer incubation periods produces thicker, more tart yogurt. Do not disturb the yogurt during incubation.\nCover the yogurt and refrigerate until cold, 2 to 3 hours. (If you used a thermos to incubate, transfer the finished yogurt to a non-insulated container for chilling so the temperature will drop.) Stir any flavorings into the yogurt just before serving. (For thicker, Greek-style yogurt, after incubation, spoon the yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined colander set over a bowl and let it drain, covered in the refrigerator, for at least 1 hour or overnight. Discard the whey that drains out of the yogurt or reserve it for another use.)\nYogurt can be stored in the refrigerator, in covered glass, ceramic, or plastic containers, for up to 2 weeks, but the flavor will be the best during the first week. As yogurt ages, it becomes more tart. If more whey separates out of the yogurt, just stir it back in before serving."

    "instructions": "1. In a plastic (preferably) container large enough to hold both the brine and the meat, mix together the water, maple syrup, salt, cure, and spices.\n2. Scoop out a scant 1 cup (200 ml) brine, and use it to load the brine injector. Then, inject the loin every 3/4 to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 cm), inserting the needle about 3/4 inch (2 cm) deep. Try to distribute the brine evenly over the loin. Place the loin in the container with the remaining brine, and keep the meat submerged with the help of a plate or an object of a similar build. Cover and refrigerate for 4 full days.\n3. Remove the loin from the brine and pat it dry. Then roll it in the meal of your choosing. Give it a day's rest, uncovered, in the fridge, so the meal and meat form as one.\n4. You have two options on cooking it: you can slice it and griddle it for a minute on each side (for thin slices that is), or you can bake it at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for about an hour, or until it has a core temperature of 142\u00b0F (61\u00b0C), then slice it. I like it the first way, especially when it gets a bit burnt on the edges and I have added a dash of maple syrup that caramelizes a bit toward the end."

While the peas are still hot, add the feta and toss to combine. This is all about texture, not smoothness, as for a dip. Add the minced garlic.\nNow add the scallions and 2 tablespoons shredded mint. Stir in the juice of half a lemon to start with. Season with pepper and a little salt, if you think it is needed; feta is pretty salty.

Revolve each egg to splatter the entire surface. Allow the eggs to dry for several hours.\n2. Seal the hole in the wider end of each blown egg with a small piece of masking tape. Using the pliers, gently chip away the shell around the other hole, enlarging it to the size of a pea. Place the eggs in an egg carton, open-end up.\n3. One at a time, fill the eggs with chocolate: Place 1 cup of the baking chips in a food storage bag and twist the bag like a pastry bag to secure the chips in one bottom corner. Microwave on medium for 1 minute, until soft. Snip the corner from the bag and pipe the chocolate into the egg, tapping the egg periodically to compress any air bubbles and filling it completely, to the top of the hole.\n4. Refrigerate the eggs overnight so the chocolate is firm. Remove the masking tape. Store in the refrigerator if not eating soon.\n5. Tap the eggs on the table to crack the shells, and peel. Yum."

If it's too thick, add a little more milk. The batter should look somewhat free-form, not doughy.\n3. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting.\n4. Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 4 inches into a large, heavy saucepan and heat to 375\u00b0F on a deep-fry thermometer. Drop the onion fritter batter into the hot oil by the tablespoonful, a few at a time, and fry, turning once, until the fritters are golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes in all. The fritters will have an irregular, spiderlike look, with a few loose pieces of onion escaping here and there. Check a fritter by breaking it open to see if the center Is cooked; it it still seems unset, cook 1 minute more. Drain on paper towels. Place the fritters in the oven to keep warm while you finish frying them all. Serve on a doily-lined platter or in a lined woven basket accompanied by the dipping sauce in one or more bowls."

      "5 large eggs",

      "sugar",
      "1 1 limoncello liqueur",
      "water",
      "mascarpone at room temperature",
      "40 ladyfingers preferably imported italian savoiardi or more as needed",
      "a double boiler with a large stainless steel bowl and a wide saucepan to hold it a large flexible wire whisk a shallow rimmed pan for moistening the savoiardi with syrup",
      "for assembling the tiramis\u00f9 a shallow casserole or baking dish with 3 quart capacity",
      "such as a 9 by 13 inch pyrex pan"
    ],
    "instructions": "Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs, putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.\nRemove the zest of two or more of the lemons, using a fine grater, to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.\nTo make the base for the tiramis\u00f9, heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat, beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the limoncello until well blended. Set the bowl over the simmering water, and whisk constantly, frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl, as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge, 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface, take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.\nMeanwhile, pour the remaining cup of limoncello, all of the lemon juice, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.\nIn another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks.\nWhen the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.\nPour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly\u2014if it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.\nScoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream.\nSmooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramis\u00f9 airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramis\u00f9 in any size you like, and life each out of the pan and onto dessert plates."

Using a serving spoon, form meringue into 6 mounds about 2 inches apart on parchment. Using a soupspoon, lightly press down and swirl center of each meringue to spread out slightly, into a 3 1/2- to 4-inch round, and create a 1 1/2- to 2-inch-wide indentation in center.\nBake meringues until dry but still white, about 2 hours, then cool meringues in turned-off oven (with door closed) 1 hour. (Meringues will be crisp on outside and slightly soft in center.) Cool meringues completely on baking sheet on a rack.\nWhile meringues cool, bring 5 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour cardamom syrup over strawberries in a heatproof bowl and stir gently to combine.\nJust before serving, beat cream with 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom in a clean bowl using clean beaters until it just holds stiff peaks.\nPeel meringues from parchment and put on 6 plates, then spoon about 1/4 cup berries with syrup into each indentation. Spoon whipped cream over berries and top with another 1/4 cup berries with syrup. Serve strawberry clouds immediately."
